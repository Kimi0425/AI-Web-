However, excessive biofilm growth can create resistance to ammonia transfer within the biofilm, posing a challenge to maintaining stable MABR performance. In hybrid MABRs, membrane modules are typically placed in anoxic tanks; nevertheless, air scouring of overgrown biofilm can alter redox conditions and impair denitrification performance. This study explores an alternative approach by deploying MABR modules in an aerobic tank to treat mixed municipal and agricultural wastewater and evaluates the ammonia removal performance and microbial community composi -  tions. A pilot-scale system, consisting of an anoxic (5.0 m 3 ), an aerobic (MABR) (4.7 m 3 ), and a membrane bioreactor tanks (5.2 m 3 ), was operated first without (0 – 78 days) and then with (79 – 259 days) membrane modules in the aerobic tank. The MABR achieved an average specific nitrification rate of 2.48 g-N/m 2 /d, comparable to the rates in anoxic tanks (0.27 – 3.1 g-N/m 2 /d). Introducing the additional MABR module increased the volumetric nitrogen removal rate from 0.39 to 0.47 kg-N/m 3 /d without compromising nitrification efficiency, demonstrating controllable nitrification. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed similar nitrifying microbial abundances in both activated sludge and biofilm, with higher transcript levels in the biofilm, sug -  gesting its role as a nitrification hotspot. Quantitative PCR results further indicated the dominance of complete ammonia oxidizers, likely instrumental in energy-efficient nitrification. The findings highlight the potential of MABRs in aerobic tanks for stable and efficient nitrogen removal, upgrading wastewater bioreactors with insufficient nitrogen removal performance.  1.   Introduction  A   membrane-aerated   biofilm   reactor   (MABR)   is   an   emerging wastewater treatment technology that offers up to 74 % energy savings as oxygen delivery via a gas-permeable membrane substantially im -  proves oxygen transfer efficiency   [1] . By employing a counter-current diffusion biofilm geometry, an MABR offers a superior performance of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in a single tank   [2] . For these reasons, the number of pilot-scale MABR demonstrations using commercialized gas-permeable membranes increases   [3,4] . In contrast, long-term MABR operations have been implemented at full-scale and/or pilot-scale levels   [3,5,6] .  To intensify nitrogen removal performances, an MABR is combined with a conventional activated sludge (CAS) process or a modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) process, termed a hybrid MABR (H-MABR)   [5] . A membrane module immersed in an anoxic tank of an MLE process, allowing the formation of an aerobic biofilm, enhances total nitrogen (TN) removal by accelerating SND   [5] . However, a high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration in an anoxic tank potentially grew heterotrophic bacteria onto the aerobic biofilm on a gas-permeable membrane   [5] . The excessive growth of heterotrophic bacteria at the biofilm exterior prolongs the diffusion distance of ammonia from the bulk liquid to the biofilm interior where nitrifiers are mainly present, limiting ammonia for nitrifiers and eventually retarding the nitrification rate. Compromising nitrification activity limits oxygen consumption by nitrifying bacteria, rendering the remaining oxygen to heterotrophic bacteria and causing oxygen competition between the nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria in the biofilm interior   [5] . In addition, further  *   Corresponding author.  E-mail address:   akte@cc.tuat.ac.jp   (A. Terada).

biofilm expansion may cause membrane bridging, where excessive biomass on each hollow fiber blocks the water channel, often deterio -  rating the MABR performances   [3] . Gas scouring has been broadly applied in MABR studies   [3]   as a strategy to control biofilm thickness. Although inert nitrogen gas instead of air was applied to prevent high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the liquid phase in an anoxic tank   [7] , air is often employed because of its simple setup,   e.g. , an air compressor   available   in   an   existing   wastewater   treatment   facility. Nevertheless, extended aeration in an anoxic tank for excessive biofilm detachment from a membrane module potentially increases the DO concentration, impairing the denitrification activities by heterotrophic bacteria in an anoxic tank. The challenge of biofilm control in MABR studies has yet to be overcome.  Instead, immersing a membrane module in an aeration tank of an MLE process could flexibly adjust the extent of air scouring to a mem -  brane module without affecting denitrification performance. Moreover, an aerobic tank, set after an anoxic tank in an MLE process, receives a lower organic carbon concentration, providing a less competitive envi -  ronment for nitrifying bacteria with heterotrophic bacteria near the membrane surface. As for nitrifying guilds, not only canonical ammonia- oxidizing bacteria (AOB) but also comammox   Nitrospira   may be involved in nitrification. Given that comammox   Nitrospira   possesses superior metabolic traits with high affinities for ammonia and oxygen   [8 – 11]   for energy-saving ammonia removal, its abundance and transcription in MABRs require further descriptions. Despite the potential advantage of an MABR to boost nitrification by comammox   Nitrospira , a pilot-scale H-MABR system, where a membrane module is immersed in an aero -  bic tank, has barely been investigated practically. Hence, the broad application of MABR in an aerobic tank has been limited. Given the potential significance, operating conditions in an H-MABR immersed in an aerobic tank of an MLE process require further investigations to improve nitrogen removal performances.  Collectively, the objectives of this study were to evaluate organic carbon and nitrogen removal performances of the H-MABR integrating a gas-permeable membrane module in an aeration tank and to charac -  terize microbial community compositions in the biofilm and activated sludge in the aerobic tank. The H-MABR, which had a membrane module installed into an aerobic tank, was placed between an anoxic and membrane bioreactor (MBR) tank, forming an anoxic/aerobic (MABR)/ MBR system configuration. The long-term operation of the system with or without immersing a membrane module into an aerobic reactor was conducted to display the effectiveness of an MABR in an anoxic/aerobic/ MBR system. Furthermore, the effect of a specific membrane surface area on a volumetric nitrogen removal rate was investigated to confirm the efficacy of adjusting a membrane surface area to control nitrification performance in an aerobic tank. The advocated H-MABR likely brings technological benefits by (i) augmenting a nitrification process by adjusting membrane surface area and (ii) simplifying scouring proced -  ures by implementing it in an aerobic basin. The results will contribute significantly to commercializing an MABR, which has struggled to deter excessive biofilm growth.  2.   Materials and methods  2.1.   Pilot-scale MABR system configuration  A system configuration of the H-MABR, consisting of consecutive anoxic, aerobic (MABR), and MBR tanks ( Fig. 1 ), was constructed in a backyard in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Tahara City in Aichi Prefecture, Japan). The volumes of the anoxic, aerobic (MABR), and MBR tanks were 5.0 m 3 , 4.7 m 3 , and 5.2 m 3 , respectively. The aer -  obic tank installed an MABR and an aeration diffuser, which mixed activated sludge with wastewater constituents to mitigate the mass transfer limitations to a biofilm. An MBR tank was set after the aeration tank, serving as an extended aeration and solid-liquid separation unit. Note that the MBR was initially designed for this aim due to the limited footprint of a regular secondary sedimentation tank; however, the H- MABR can also be applied to a secondary sedimentation tank, as often found in an MLE system. The effluent pump in the MBR tank was continuously operated (48 L/min) to ensure a total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5.26 h, whereas the influent pump was intermittently turned on and off when the water level of the MBR tank dropped and reached 2990 mm and 3130 mm, respectively. The difference in the total volume of the system was within 1.6 %.   In situ   membrane cleaning by backwashing in the MBR tank was performed every two weeks by sup -  plying 500 mg/L of sodium hypochlorite at 8 L/min for 30 min to maintain the constant inflow supply. Excess sludge was drained manu -  ally, ensuring an average solids retention time of 9.3 days. The recir -  culation ratio from the MBR tank to the anoxic tank was 200 % of the influent rate. The influent was a mixture of municipal and agricultural wastewater from the sewers of residential areas and agricultural settle -  ments. The average NH 4  + -N, NO 3      -N, NO 2      -N, COD Cr   concentrations, temperature, and pH are summarized in   Table 1   (pH, DO, and ORP: see  Fig. S1 ).  Fig. 1.

The membrane module ( Fig. S2 ), immersed in an aerobic tank, consisted of membrane cassettes aligned in parallel. A cassette can be attached and detached to adjust a specific membrane surface area. Each cassette was comprised of bundles of hollow fiber membranes (Mitsu -  bishi Chemical Corporation, Japan). The membranes were made of non- porous polyethylene with a 190   μ m in outer diameter, 130   μ m in inner diameter, and 1200 mm in length. Due to its non-porous structure, it allows a bubbleless supply of oxygen. Mixing in the aerobic tank was provided by an aeration diffuser at an airflow rate of 150 L/min, set next to the module to prevent sludge sedimentation. Scouring air, provided by the other blower just beneath the membrane module ( Fig. 1 ), was intermittently every 12 h for 5 min with 400 L/min supplied via aera -  tion diffuser integrated into the module. The air diffuser in the MBR continuously supplied atmospheric air at 1400 L/min.  2.2.   Operation conditions  The operation of the H-MABR was conducted for 259 days, divided into three phases, as summarized in   Table 2 . To confirm the effective -  ness of an MABR module as a strategy to boost nitrification, an HRT of the aerobic (MABR) tank throughout the entire operation period was consistently adjusted to 1.66 h. This HRT was too short to ensure stable ammonia oxidation without an MABR module; however, the step-wise addition of MABR cassettes allowed the investigation of the membrane surface area effect on nitrification performance. The effects of the membrane module installation on enhancing nitrification performances were evaluated from Phase 1 – 2, while those of the number of membrane cassettes on nitrification rates were examined from Phase 2 – 3. The membrane module, consisting of four membrane cassettes, was installed in Phase 2, ensuring a specific membrane surface area of 23.5 m 2 /m 3 . Another four membrane cassettes were mounted at the beginning of Phase 3 to increase the specific membrane surface area of 55.7 m 2 /m 3 . The applied pressure in the membrane lumen was kept at 40 kPa by monitoring a digital pressure gauge (KDM30, Krone Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). A gas flow rate through a membrane module was 5 L/min and 10 L/min in Phases 2 and 3, respectively. A specific nitrification rate by an MABR ( NR MABR ) [g-N/m 2 /day] in the aerobic tank was calculated using   Eq. (1)   to compare the nitrification performances of an H-MABR.  NR MABR   =  { ( NH +  4       N in       NH +  4       N out   )  1000   ×   24  HRT       NR AS  }  ×   V A  (1)  where   NH 4  + -N in   and   NH 4  + -N out   are   ammonia   concentrations   in influent and effluent of the aerobic tank (MABR) [mg-N/L], respectively; HRT is a hydraulic retention time [hour];   NR AS   is an average volumetric nitrification rate at Phase 1 (devoid of an MABR) [g/m 3 /d];   V   is the volume of the aerobic tank [L]; and   A   is an effective membrane surface area [m 2 ].  2.3.   Analytical methods  All effluent samples were taken weekly and filtered through a glass fiber filter (No.5C, Advantec, Tokyo, Japan) before water quality anal -  ysis. Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were measured with a TOC analyzer with a TN measurement unit (TOC- 310V, Nittoseiko Analytech, Kanagawa, Japan). Ammonia and COD Cr  were measured weekly using a spectrophotometer (Hach Company, Loveland, Co, USA). Water temperature (R96W, Okazaki Manufacturing Company, Tokyo, Japan) was averaged throughout the day, and pH (TPX-999Si, Tokokagaku, Tokyo, Japan) was measured once a week. Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) (TPX-999Si) and dissolved oxygen (DO) (ID-160T, Iijima EIectronics, Aichi, Japan) concentrations were also measured once a week.  2.4.   Microbial community compositions analysis  Activated sludge and biofilm samples were taken on day 159. The biofilm samples were taken from the top, bottom, and module interior positions of the membrane bundles, as indicated in   Fig. 1 . DNA was extracted from these biomasses by a FastDNA SPIN Kit and a FastPrep-24 instrument (MP-Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol. Concerning RNA samples, the biomasses were soaked into an RNA later ®   Stabilization Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scienti -  fic, Waltham, MA, USA) overnight at 4   ◦ C according to the manufac -  turer ’ s protocol.   Subsequently, the   samples were   subjected   to RNA extraction by a FastRNA Pro Blue kit (MP-Biomedicals) and quantification by a Qubit RNA HSH assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Subsequently, reverse transcription was conducted using a QuantiTect Reverse Tran -  scription Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA). The detailed protocols can be found elsewhere   [12] . The amplicon sequencing of the prepared 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA molecule was performed by amplifying the hypervariable region V4 ac -  cording to previous work   [12] . The attained DNA amplicons were pro -  cessed for analysis, as previously reported   [12] . Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined by a 97 % sequence identity threshold. The sequencing data have been deposited in DDBJ under the BioSample accession   number   SAMD00803396-SAMD00803411.   The   BioSample accession PRJDB18158 was linked to the database.  2.5.   Functional gene abundance and transcription analyses  Quantitative PCR was conducted to quantify the gene abundance and expression of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms.

precisely the same as those for the microbial community compositions were   subjected   to   gene   quantifications.   To   distinguish   ammonia- oxidizing   microorganisms,   three   PCR   primers   for   ammonia   mono -  oxygenases genes of canonical AOB   amoA   (amoA1f-amoA2r   [13] ), archaeal   amoA   (Arch-amoAf-Arch-amoAr   [14] ), and comammox   Nitro -  sopira amoB   (cmx_amoB-148F-cmx_amoB_485R   [15] ) were employed. The PCR conditions for the primer sets are referred to in the previous work   [16] .  2.6.   Data analysis  The R Studio environment (Version: 2024.04.2 + 764) was employed for the microbial community analysis,   i.e. , abundance and PCoA, by using the qiime2R 0.99.6 package. A   t -test was performed by Microsoft Excel.   Kruskal-Wallis   tests   followed   by   pairwise   comparisons   with Bonferroni correction were conducted by IBM SPSS Statistics, version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).  3.   Results  3.1.   Removal performance of H-MABR  Regular biweekly membrane backwashing with NaClO in the MBR tank deterred membrane fouling, ensuring a stable discharge rate at 48 L/min by the effluent pump (Data not shown). Influent and effluent concentrations of TOC, COD Cr , NH 4  + -N, TN, and NO 2 + 3      -N are shown in  Fig. 2 . Carbon and nitrogen concentrations in influent broadly fluctu -  ated due to seasonal variations and meteorological influences,   e.g. , local downpours. The effluent carbon and nitrogen concentrations were kept stable despite the fluctuating influent concentrations. The average TOC removal efficiency in the aerobic (MABR) tank was 54.5   ±   19.5 % in Phase 1 when the membrane module was absent. Its efficiency improved to   74.3   ±   13.7 %   and   74.9   ±   13.2 %   ( t -test:   Phase   1   vs.   Phase   2,  p   =   0.02; Phase 1   vs.   Phase 3,   p   =   0.02) after installing the membrane module and adding membrane cassettes in Phases 2 and 3 ( Fig. 2 A and  Table 2 ), respectively. Similar trends were observed with the average COD Cr   removal efficiencies in the aerobic (MABR) tank: 65.9   ±   18.3 %,  Fig. 2.   Time courses of TOC (A), CODcr (B), NH 4  + -N (C), T-N (D), and NO 2      -N and NO 3      -N concentrations (E) throughout the entire operation.  Y. Kigo et al.

76.9   ±   17.3 % (Phase 1   vs.   Phase 2,   p   >   0.05), and 82.4   ±   10.5 % (Phase 1   vs.   Phase 3,   p   =   0.02) in Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively ( Fig. 2 B). This result indicates that an H-MABR retrofitted and consoli -  dated an existing activated sludge system concerning biodegradable carbon. A similar trend was observed in the removal of nitrogen. The average removal efficiency of NH 4  + -N in the aerobic (MABR) tank was 59.1   ±   6.31 % in Phase 1, and its efficiency increased to 75.1   ±   7.3 % (Phase 1   vs.   Phase 2,   p   =   0.00003) after immersing the membrane module in the aerobic tank ( Fig. 2 C). Improving NH 4  +   removal could be due   to   the   enriched   biomass   on   the   membrane   surface.   Further improvement of nitrification was observed to 81.7   ±   6.3 % (Phase 1   vs.  Phase 3,   p   =   0.0000001) in Phase 3. The average removal efficiencies of TN were 62.2   ±   6.2 %, 77.9   ±   6.1 % (Phase 1   vs.   Phase 2,   p   =   0.00001), and 80.6   ±   5.6 % (Phase 1   vs.   Phase 3,   p   =   0.000001) in Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively ( Fig. 2 D). NO 3      was the dominant nitrogen oxide in the aerobic (MABR) and MBR tanks,   i.e. , 1.62   ±   1.47 mg-N/L and 5.41  ±   2.72 mg-N/L, respectively ( Fig. 2 E). NO 2      was barely detected,   i.e. , 0.022   ±   0.031 mg-N/L in the MBR tank ( Fig. 2 E). The nitrifying per -  formance did not deteriorate in Phase 3 when the water temperature decreased to 15 º C ( Fig. S3 ). These results suggested that the membrane module was instrumental in enhancing nitrification. Immersing MABR modules in an existing aerobic tank can retrofit an activated sludge treating organic carbon and nitrogen from a mixture of municipal and agricultural wastewater.  The contribution of the MABR tank over the total system for COD Cr  removal is summarized   Fig. S4   and   Table S1 . Although the COD Cr  removal contribution by the aerobic (MABR) tank increased in the entire system, no statistical difference with or without an MABR unit was attained ( p   >   0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by pairwise compari -  sons with Bonferroni correction). On the contrary, the NH 4  + -N removal contribution of the aerobic tank over the entire system increased by installing the membrane module (Phase 2), as summarized in   Table S1 . Adding the membrane cassettes further increased the NH 4  + -N removal contribution of the aerobic tank (Phase 3 in   Table S1 ); however, sta -  tistical difference was not observed ( p   =   0.067). These results indicate the significance of the MABR to boost nitrification capacity.  3.2.   Evaluation of nitrification  Fig. 3   shows the weekly average specific and volumetric nitrification rates. There was a significant difference in the volumetric nitrification rate between Phases 1 and 2, which increased from 171   ±   60 g-N/m 3 / d to 261   ±   39 g-N/m 3 /d ( p -value   <   0.01) on average in Phases 1 and 2, respectively. The former nitrification rate was employed as   NR AS   in   Eq. (1) . A volumetric nitrification rate was further increased to 343   ±   47 g- N/m 3 /d ( p -value   <   0.01) on average in Phase 3. This result shows that the increased membrane surface area increased the volumetric nitrifi -  cation rate from Phase 2 – 3. No statistically significant difference in an average specific nitrification rate ( NR MABR ) was attained between Pha -  ses 2 and 3 ( p   =   0.388). The average   NR MABR   of the entire operation period (Phases 2 and 3) was 2.48 g-N/m 2 /d.  The COD/NH 4  + -N of the influent is shown in   Fig. 4 . The COD/NH 4  + -N ratio widely fluctuated from 5 to 40 during operation. Despite a higher COD/N ratio of municipal and agricultural wastewater mixture than municipal wastewater   [17] , stable nitrification was achieved without mass transfer limitation of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds caused by excessive biofilm formation onto membranes. The result indicated that the nitrification activity by the biofilm grown on the membranes was robust as a function of a COD/N ratio in the incoming wastewater.  3.3.   Microbial community compositions  The bacterial composition at the class level at different locations of the membrane module is shown in   Fig. 5 A. The significant classes,  Bacteroidia ,   Gammaproteobacteria ,   Anaerolineae ,   Polyangia , and   Plancto -  mycetes , were present with comparable relative abundances of the activated sludge and biofilms at all module locations in the H-MABR. The relative abundances (DNA) of the nitrifying communities and transcriptional activities in the activated sludge and on the membrane- aerated biofilm (cDNA) are shown in   Fig. 5 B. The 16S rRNA gene showcased the comparative abundances of the families   Nitrospiraceae  and   Nitrosomonadaceae   with   the   marginal   presence   of   ammonia- oxidizing archaea   Nitrososphaeraceae   irrespective of the sampling loca -  tions. Further microbial community analysis at the OTU level showed that the uncultured   Nitrospira   was detected as the primary nitrifying bacterium ( Fig. S5 ). The transcript abundances of nitrifying bacteria on the membrane surface were higher than those of activated sludge. The uncultured   Nitrospira   and the OTU close to   Nitrospira defluvii , a dedicated nitrite-oxidizing bacterium, were metabolically active in comparison with the OTU close to the uncultured   Nitrosomonas , a canonical AOB ( Fig. S6 ). These results suggested that the membrane surface can be a hotspot for nitrifying bacteria in an H-MABR. The unweighted PCoA analysis of the extant and metabolically active microbial community composition is shown in   Fig. 6 . The community composition based on the 16S rRNA genes did not differ across the sampling locations. In contrast, metabolically active microbial compositions based on the 16S rRNA (cDNA) were distinct between the activated sludge and biofilm samples. They also differed in the sampling locations in the membrane module.  Fig. 3.   Time course of nitrification and volumetric nitrification rate.

3.4.   Functional gene abundance and transcription analyses  The abundances of bacterial   amoA , archaeal   amoA,   and comammox  amoB   genes were measured by qPCR at different locations in the mem -  brane module and activated sludge. Comammox   amoB   gene densities were two orders of magnitude larger than bacterial   amoA   and archaeal  amoA   gene densities in all module locations and activated sludge, as shown in   Fig. 7 . Similarly, the abundances of comammox   amoB   gene transcripts (cDNA) were higher than those of canonical AOB   amoA   and archaeal   amoA   gene   transcripts   ( Fig.   S7 ),   indicating   that   bacteria harboring   amoB   actively oxidized ammonia in the H-MABR. The gene transcripts of AOB,   e.g. ,   Nitrosomonas   spp., were below the detection limit in the MABR biofilms ( Fig. S7 ), suggesting that the uncultured  Nitrospira , identified in   Fig. S5 , is likely to be ammonia oxidizers.  4.   Discussion  4.1.   Appraisals of H-MABR submerging a membrane module in an aerobic tank  To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a gas- permeable membrane module in an aerobic tank of a pilot-scale H- MABR system was instrumental in improving organic carbon and ni -  trogen   removal.   The   volumetric   nitrification   rate   and   the   aerobic (MABR) tank contribution to NH 4  +   removal increased after applying the membrane module, underpinning that the MABR unit augmented the nitrification performance ( Fig. 3   and   Table S1 ). A previous H-MABR study installed a membrane unit into an anoxic tank of an MLE system  [3] . Whereas an H-MABR boosted total nitrogen removal, a challenge lies in air scouring for biofilm thickness control to maintain nitrification performance   [18]   and, if excessive, a redox change in an anoxic tank, compromising   denitrification   performance.   Air   scouring   onto   the membrane module immersed in an aerobic tank for 5 min air scouring every   12 h,   implemented   in   this   study, successfully   prevented   the decrease in nitrification activity. This result displays the robustness of the membrane module as a method to improve nitrification performance in a hybrid system. Given that the average organic carbon and NH 4  + -N concentrations of treated water were 55   ±   32 mg-C/L and 65   ±   37 mg-C/L, and 5.6   ±   1.9 mg-N/L and 4.8   ±   1.8 mg-N/L in Phases 2 and 3 under biofilm thickness control, respectively, the air scouring approach contributed to the stable nitrification performance without compro -  mising organic carbon and nitrogen removal performances. Besides, as shown in   Fig. 4 , the ammonia oxidation performances did not deterio -  rate regardless of the fluctuated influent COD/NH 4  +   ratios (from 4 to 40). Maintaining the ammonia removal performance even at a high influent COD/NH 4  +   ratio suggests the stable nitrification in the biofilm interior, likely caused by scouring for biofilm thickness control, as a common MABR challenge   [19] . The successful long-term operation without per -  formance deterioration at the broad COD/N ratios corroborates the benefit of an MABR in an aerobic tank, mitigating the risks of biofilm overgrowth and massive biofilm loss due to intensive scouring. The re -  sults in this study also suggest the broad applicability of an H-MABR to a CAS system, which has been widely practiced. MABRs are expected to enhance ammonia oxidation capacity and potentially accelerate the further dissemination of MABRs.  To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, demonstrated that an ammonia removal rate can be adjusted by the number of membrane cassettes immersed in a pilot-scale H-MABR system. An advantage of an MABR stems from easy oxygen supply adjustment to the biofilm by an applied air pressure. On the other hand, the amount of biofilm in a reactor vessel increases with the membrane surface area in a non-linear proportional manner   [20] . This study added another adjustability of nitrification performances to the previous findings: adjusting the num -  ber of membrane cassettes in a module provides the opportunity to appropriately set a specific surface area of gas-permeable membranes as an oxygen-delivering material and scaffold for biofilm formation. The step-wise increase in the number of membrane cassettes, as outlined in  Table 2 , confirmed that the volumetric nitrification rate can be modu -  lated by expanding the membrane surface area in response to changes in the influent nitrogen load ( Fig. 3 ). Inserting and pulling off membrane cassettes offers a flexible option,   e.g. , when nitrification performance is exacerbated due to a temperature decrease in winter. Our pilot-scale result provides an opportunity for an MABR to independently and adequately augment removal performances by adjusting not only air pressure but also membrane surface area.  The efficient ammonia removal was proven in this study by simply detaching   biofilm   through   constant   air   scouring   without   biomass monitoring. In the early stages of operation, factors such as membrane surface   roughness   and   hydrophilicity   significantly   impact   biofilm adhesion   [21] . On the other hand, as the operation proceeds, the biofilm  Fig. 6.   Unweighted PCoA analysis of the extant and transcriptomically active microbial community compositions in the aerobic tank.  Y.

thickness   fluctuates   depending   on   hydraulics,   membrane   module arrangement, and nutrient compositions. Despite fluctuations in the influent COD/NH 4  + -N ratio from 5 to 40, the stable ammonia removal rates were accomplished during Phases 2 and 3 ( Fig. 4 ) without chal -  lenges such as membrane bridging, which significantly deteriorates ni -  trogen removal   [22] . Avoiding membrane bridging was likely due to intensive air scouring in an aerobic tank, which cannot be usually implemented in an anaerobic tank, and a relatively lower specific membrane surface area (to be discussed below). This result suggested that an MABR system with a membrane module immersed in an aerobic tank is a plausible option to overcome the challenges of conventional H-MABR.  The H-MABR system in this study submerged in an aerobic tank is applicable because the nitrification and ammonia removal rates in this study,   i.e. , 2.48 g-N/m 2 /day, are comparable to the results of H-MABR systems summarized in   Table 3 , where membrane modules were sub -  merged in anoxic tanks. Furthermore, the MLSS concentrations in our system ( Fig. S3 ) were comparable to that in Denmark but much higher than other H-MABRs   [23 – 28] , suggesting that the operation in a high MLSS condition is feasible in H-MABRs. The specific membrane surface area of this study was one order of magnitude smaller than that of most H-MABRs, except for the previous studies   [24,27] . This indicates that a further increase in the volumetric nitrification rate is expected. Given these appraisals, H-MABR systems submerged in an aeration tank can be a practical option to enhance nitrification. Further research is needed on the physicochemical properties of biofilms, nitrous oxide emissions, and the analysis of operational/capital expenditures. In addition, optimizing system operation in combination with an MBR tank remains unresolved. In this study a high aeration rate was applied to mitigate membrane biofouling in the MBR tank; however, optimizing the DO concentration  Fig. 7.

to reduce operating cost while preventing biofouling remains a crucial challenge for future research.  4.2.   Activating nitrifying guilds  Our microbiological analysis indicates that comammox   Nitrospira   are key ammonia oxidizers in an H-MABR immersed in aerobic tanks ( Figs. 5 and 7 ). The second largest abundance among the detected nitrifiers,  N. defluvii , is a canonical nitrite-oxidizing bacterium (NOB) affiliated with lineage I   Nitrospira   [29] , thriving at a low temperature,   e.g. , even 10   ◦ C, consistent with our result (approx. 15   ◦ C in Phase 3). Given  N. defluvii   as a NOB, the one-order of magnitude higher gene abundance of comammox   amoB   indicates that the uncultured   Nitrospira   are poten -  tially complete ammonia oxidizers ( Fig. 7 ). Given the comparison of the genes encoding ammonia oxidation by different ammonia oxidizers ( Fig. S6 ),   amoB   possessed by comammmox   Nitrospira   was actively expressed irrespective of the sampling locations. These results corrob -  orate the active involvement of comammox   Nitrospira   in nitrification in the aerobic (MABR) tank. The high abundance of comammox   Nitrospira  in the MABR facilitated efficient nitrification. Comammox   Nitrospira ,   e. g. ,   N. inopinata   [8]   and   Candidatus   “ Nitrospira kreftii ”   [9] , are known for their high affinities for ammonia and nitrite. Additionally, their detec -  tion in hypoxic conditions at high abundances   [10]   suggests a strong affinity for oxygen. Given the low ammonia ( Fig. 2 C) and oxygen con -  centrations ( Fig. S1 ) in the aerobic (MABR) tank, the higher abundance of comammox   amoB   than canonical AOB   amoA   ( Fig. 7 ) is reasonable. Furthermore, the high expression of   Nitrospira   16S rRNA in biofilms ( Fig. S5 ) supports the physiological traits of efficient ammonia oxidation within the biofilm interior of the MABR, where ammonia concentrations are likely lower than in the bulk liquid.  The high abundance of comammox   Nitrospira   attained in this study ( Fig. 7 ) may bring additional benefit to MABRs, which include low N 2 O emissions   and   micropollutant   removal.   The   comammox   bacterium  N. inopinata   emits far less N 2 O than canonical AOB   [30] . Although N 2 O was not measured in this study, they may be low because of the inherent counter-diffusion biofilm geometry of MABRs   [31]   and the dominance of comammox   Nitrospira   as the primary nitrifying guild. Future studies should intensively focus on N 2 O emissions from the system developed in this study. It has also been reported that MABRs efficiently degrade micropollutants,   e.g. , sulfamethoxazole   [32] , benzimidazole fungicides  [33] , and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate   [34,35] , various endocrine disruptors, and pharmaceutical compounds   [36] . Notably, comammox  Nitrospira   has shown to degrade micropollutants,   e.g. , asulam, fenhex -  amid,   mianserin,   and   ranitidine   [37] ,   more   efficiently   than   other ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Given these unique physiological traits of comammox   Nitrospira,   its presence as the primary nitrifying guild in MABRs may facilitate the removal of micropollutants with efficient nitrogen removal, which paves the way for a new paradigm in biofilm-based technology.  The presence of comammox   Nitrospira   as nitrifying bacteria is likely due to a long solids retention time (SRT) with biofilm formation on the membrane surface in the H-MABR. Comammox   Nitrospira   was detected in wastewater treatment systems with an SRT longer than 10 days   [15] . Additionally, it thrives at low NH 4  +   and DO concentrations   [8,38]   and can also grow at low temperatures   [39] . Given these reports, comammox  Nitrospira   was likely adapted to the H-MABR system with limited availability of NH 4  +   ( Fig. 2 C) at a relatively lower temperature in Phase 3 ( Fig. S3 ). The mixotrophic nature of comammox   Nitrospira ,   e.g. , guani -  dine degradation   [40] , is yet to be elucidated, which warrants a future investigation.  5.   Conclusion  We demonstrated that a pilot-scale H-MABR, with membrane mod -  ules   immersed   in   an   aerobic   tank,   effectively   enhanced   ammonia removal performance. The H-MABR can be combined with existing aeration in aerobic tanks and was validated over an extended period, including operation at low temperatures around 15   ◦ C. Inserting a membrane element into the module increased the volumetric nitrogen removal rate, highlighting the flexibility and controllability of nitrifi -  cation performance in an MABR. Molecular analysis unraveled that comammox   Nitrospira   was an active nitrifying guild in the biofilm at all membrane locations and in activated sludge, likely instrumental in cost- effective and high-performance nitrogen removal. Together, these re -  sults suggest that retrofitting a CAS with an H-MABR is effective when nitrogen removal entails augmentation. This study will facilitate the reduction of the maintenance complexity and bring extensibility to the practical application of MABRs.  CRediT authorship contribution statement  Y.

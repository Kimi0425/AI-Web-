Additionally, its counter-diffusional biofilm structure facilitates the formation of strata, which can support multiple pollutant removal pathways. In this paper, both conventional and emerging nitrogen removal pathways in MABR were reviewed including simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND), partial nitrification and denitrification (PND), and partial nitrification and anammox (PNA). To achieve high nitrogen removal efficiency through any of these pathways, operational parameters must be controlled. Nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) inhibition to accumulate nitrite is a necessary condition to suc -  cessfully achieve PND and PNA. Methods to suppress NOB (while retaining ammonia oxidizing bacteria   –   AOB) including inhibitor addition, limited oxygen supply, intermittent aeration, temperature control among others, have been used. Principal component analysis and CART ®   Regression were performed on the different opera -  tional parameters. The results indicate that the most important parameters that affect nitrogen removal efficiency via the SND pathway are pH, influent ammonia concentration, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and dissolved oxygen concentration. As MABR continues to be adopted more widely in wastewater treatment fa -  cilities globally, there is a need for further research on the effects of frequent temperature fluctuations and extreme weather conditions on SND, PND and PNA within MABR biofilm structure.  1.   Introduction  The membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) represents an inno -  vative wastewater treatment technology characterized by its distinctive gas transfer mechanism, where oxygen diffuses through gas-permeable membranes directly into attached biofilms. This configuration creates counter-diffusional system where oxygen moves from the membrane- biofilm interface while substrates diffuse from the bulk liquid, estab -  lishing distinct oxygen concentration gradients throughout the biofilm [ 1 , 2 ]. The oxygen gradient is determined by a combination of Henry ’ s Law controlling gas solubility at the membrane-biofilm interface and diffusion principles governing transport through the biofilm matrix, a structure that enables multiple biological nitrogen removal processes to occur within a single biofilm [ 3 , 4 ]. MABR offers substantial operational advantages, including superior oxygen transfer efficiency, reduced en -  ergy consumption, smaller physical footprint, and enhanced treatment capacity, all while supporting stratified microbial communities capable of performing diverse metabolic functions simultaneously.  Conventional nitrogen removal in MABR systems primarily employs simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND), where aerobic ni -  trifiers occupy oxygen-rich zones near the membrane while heterotro -  phic denitrifiers function in oxygen-limited regions farther from the membrane. However, recent research has focused on enhancing nitro -  gen removal efficiency through alternative pathways, particularly par -  tial nitrification-denitrification (PND) and partial nitritation-anammox (PNA)   processes   [ 5 – 7 ].   These   advanced   pathways   offer   significant benefits for specific applications. PND reduces oxygen and carbon re -  quirements   compared   to   conventional   nitrification-denitrification, while   PNA   provides   an   autotrophic   pathway   particularly   advanta -  geous for mainstream wastewater.  As wastewater treatment facilities face increasing challenges, stricter effluent standards, larger treatment volumes, and higher demands for energy efficiency, optimization of nitrogen removal pathways within MABRs becomes critically important [ 8 ]. Each pathway presents distinct advantages and operational requirements that must be carefully evalu -  ated for specific applications. PND offers reduced energy requirements  *   Corresponding author.  E-mail address:   oliver.iorhemen@unbc.ca   (O.T. Iorhemen).

compared to conventional SND but may face stability challenges with nitrite accumulation. However, PNA provides superior energy efficiency for nitrogen-rich, carbon-limited wastewaters but requires precise con -  trol of dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and inhibitory compounds to maintain stable anammox activity. This review examines the long- term performance sustainability of the three primary nitrogen removal pathways within MABR; SND, PND, and PNA, even as process stability remains paramount for consistent regulatory compliance and opera -  tional efficiency. By examining these pathways comparatively rather than in isolation, we identify opportunities for developing integrated or switchable MABR systems capable of adapting to varying influent characteristics while maintaining treatment objectives.  2.   Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) pathway  2.1.   Mechanism of SND pathway  Unlike the conventional biological nitrogen removal, which requires at least two independent bioreactors, the SND process takes place in a single reactor under the same operating conditions and minimizes en -  ergy consumption with improved oxygen utilization efficiency.  In the MABR systems, oxygen (electron acceptor) and the pollutants (electron donor) are supplied from the opposite side of the biofilm ( Fig.   1 ).   The   counter-diffusion   biofilm   environment   facilitates   the encounter of ammonia and oxygen at the bottom of the biofilm with negligible contact with organic carbon, thereby improving nitrification. However, the middle anoxic part of the biofilm offers an appropriate environment for denitrification, resulting in a robust nitrogen removal from wastewater [ 10 ]. Additionally, the unique counter-delivery of oxygen and pollutants creates an opposite flow pattern within the MABR systems which improves mass transfer. An exceptional redox-stratified biofilm structure is also created, which provides various ecological niches,   growth,   and   maintenance   of   numerous   microorganisms including AOB, NOB, and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria (HDB) that are essential for pollutant removal.  Several studies have demonstrated that the stratified biofilm struc -  ture of MABR systems is effective for achieving SND in a single reactor [ 9 , 11 – 13 ]. The stratified biofilm contains aerobic and anoxic zones and provide habitats for both nitrifiers and denitrifies, which are responsible for SND [ 11 , 12 ]. MABR systems employing the SND process have been utilized to treat various wastewater types, including landfill leachate [ 14 ], pharmaceutical wastewater [ 15 ], and ammonia-rich wastewater [ 16 ], among others. Additionally, these systems have been successfully implemented at both pilot- and full-scale levels [ 17 , 18 ].  2.1.1.   SND microbial communities   –   nitrification  Generally, two microbial groups are involved in the nitrification process, AOB and NOB. Nitrification process takes place in the oxygen- rich and carbon-depleted inner region of the biofilm (aerobic zone near the membrane surface) where nitrifying bacteria (AOB and NOB) colo -  nize ( Fig. 1 ).   Nitrosomonas, Nitrosovibrio, Nitrosococcus ,   Proteobacteria, Nitrosospira, Nitrosolobus,   and   Betaproteobacteria   are some of the re -  ported AOBs that dominate in MABR, and oxidize ammonia to nitrite [ 16 , 19 , 20 ]. These slow-growing AOBs are generally sensitive to envi -  ronmental conditions such as temperature, ammonia concentration, and pH and are inhibited by low oxygen supply. For example, it has been reported in the literature that   Nitrosolobus   sp. are more abundant in systems with relatively low ammonia concentration (about 250 mg/L), while   Nitrosomonas   sp. are more abundant in ammonia-rich systems (about 500 to 600 mg/L) [ 21 – 23 ]. Bunse et al. [ 5 ] reported enhanced AOB activities in MABR with continuous aeration, which ensured an adequate   oxygen   supply.   AOB   consume   oxygen   and   oxidize   the ammonia in the wastewater to nitrite in the aerobic zone as shown in Eq.  (1)   [ 9 ]:  NH 3   +   1 . 5   O 2   → NO    2   +   H +   +   H 2 O   Δ G   =     272 kJ / mol   (1)  Fig. 1.   Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in a single-stage MABR.  (Modified Ravishankar et al. [ 9 ].)  R.N. Vesuwe et al.   Journal   of   Water   Process   Engineering   74   (2025)   107758  2
The nitrite produced by AOB acts as the electron donor and is oxidized to nitrate by NOB in the aerobic zone, which completes the nitrification process ( Fig. 1 ). Some of the reported NOB that oxidize nitrite   to   nitrate   in   MABR   systems   include   Nitrobacter,   Nitrospira, Nitrococcus , and   Nitrospina   [ 16 , 105 ]. Several factors, such as oxygen concentration, carbon source and nitrite concentration, can influence the abundance of specific genera in MABR systems. For example, ac -  cording to a study by Bartosch et al. [ 24 ],   Nitrobacter   species flourished well in higher concentrations of nitrite (2 g NaNO 2 /L), whereas   Nitro -  spira   thrived well in low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 g NaNO 2 /L). Ni -  trite oxidation is shown in Eq.   (2)   [ 9 ]:  NO    2   +   O 2   +   2 H + → NO    3   +   H 2 O   Δ G   =     77 kJ / mol   (2)  2.1.2.   SND microbial communities   –   denitrification  Denitrification takes place in the oxygen-depleted and carbon-rich outer region of the biofilm (anoxic zone near the bulk liquid) under the action of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria (HDB) ( Fig. 1 ). Since the detection of the   Thiosphaera pantotropha   strain by Robertson et al. [ 25 ], several other aerobic denitrifying bacteria which can aid the SND pathway in MABR systems have been reported. These strains include  Hyphomicrobium, Methylobacterium, Gammaproteobacteria, Paracoccus, Alcaligenes, Bacillus   and   Pseudomonas   [ 16 , 26 – 28 ]. The abundance of these strains during the denitrification process in MABR systems is influenced by several factors including oxygen supply and carbon- to ‑ nitrogen ratio. Lan et al. [ 12 ] reported   Pseudomonas   sp. B-1 ,   hetero -  trophic   nitrification-aerobic   denitrification   strain,   isolated   from membrane-aerated biofilm as the major microorganism in SND process.  Pseudomonas   denitrifiers tend to dominate MABR systems because of the strata structure of MABR systems, which allows the development of oxygen-rich regions where oxygen is used as the sole electron acceptor and other regions of limited oxygen supply where both oxygen and ni -  trate are used as electron acceptors. These denitrifying bacteria reduce the nitrate formed by the NOB into nitrite and then to molecular ni -  trogen as shown in Eq.   (3)   and   Fig. 1   [ 16 ].  NO    3   → NO    2   → N 2   (3)  The nitrate formed during nitrification acts as the electron acceptor in the denitrification process and thus the two processes (nitrification and denitrification) complementarily take place within the MABR [ 29 ]. Additionally, the reduced pH in the reactor by the nitrification process is raised during the denitrification process eliminating the need for alka -  linity addition in a single-stage MABR system aimed at SND. For SND in MABR systems, there is a need to manipulate operating conditions especially oxygen supply rate and air pressure to prevent unnecessary competition for oxygen by the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and aerobic nitrifying bacteria.  2.2.   Optimal operating conditions for SND in MABR systems  2.2.1.   Operating conditions reported by selected previous studies  Process operating conditions, particularly aeration, specific mem -  brane surface area, C/N ratio, and ammonia concentration can influence pollutant removal efficiency in MABR systems. For example, Terada et al. [ 13 ] reported that ammonia removal in MABR was greatly influ -  enced by the membrane surface area and air pressure which controlled the oxygen supply rate. The study reported an optimal aeration pressure of 23 kPa to promote the co-existence of both AOB and NOB and favourable competition for oxygen between these two groups of bacte -  ria. The specific membrane surface area available for microbial attach -  ment in MABR systems positively correlates with oxygen transfer rates, hence nitrogen removal. For example, Terada et al. [ 30 ] reported lower volumetric nitrogen removal via SND because of lower specific mem -  brane surface area (50 m 2 /m 3 ) in comparison to other similar studies that used specific membrane surface areas of 447 m 2 /m 3   [ 31 ] and 5100 m 2 /m 3   [ 32 ]. Researchers have reported inconsistent optimal specific membrane surface area for enhanced MABR performance via SND, although the standard specific area can range from 7 to 1733 m 2 /m 3  [ 33 , 34 ]. With regards to oxygen concentration, Huang et al. [ 26 ], investigated the influence of DO on nitrogen removal via the SND pathway and reported that low oxygen concentration of about 0.5 mg/L was the most favourable for SND, with the system achieving 99.52 % nitrogen removal. Paetkau   &   Cicek [ 35 ] also reported 80 % total ni -  trogen removal via SND in an MABR system where the DO concentration was maintained at 0.7 mg/L. This indicates that a low DO condition is adequate for the SND pathway.  The nitrification process in MABR is negatively affected by the C/N ratio in the influent wastewater. Zhang et al. [ 36 ] indicated an optimum C/N ratio for effective nitrification in MABR as 2 and 5. Li et al. [ 37 ] found that a C/N ratio of   < 5 is optimal for the SND process because excessive carbon supply favours the overgrowth of heterotrophic bac -  teria which can inhibit the activities of nitrifying bacteria (AOB and NOB) by competing for oxygen. Other mathematical model evaluations and experimental investigations reported 3.75 – 4.00 as the optimal C/N ratio for higher SND performance in MABR systems [ 9 , 38 – 40 ]. The re -  ported C/N ratio of 3.75 – 4.00 is close to the theoretical value of 3.71 which is the optimal C/N ratio based on stoichiometry and considering microbial growth for denitrification [ 41 ]. In contrast, SND has also been achieved at a very low C/N ratio for high-strength nitrogenous waste -  water. For example, Terada et al. [ 30 ] achieved SND with a lower C/N ratio of 1 for synthetic high-strength nitrogenous swine wastewater where most of the nitrogenous compounds were removed via nitrite- denitrification instead of nitrate-denitrification.  Influent ammonia concentration can also influence the SND process in MABR systems. In a study by Lin et al. [ 16 ], an ammonia concen -  tration   > 70 mg/L negatively affected nitrogen removal via SND. A higher concentration of ammonia (above 70 mg/L) in the MABR system may have resulted in a thicker biofilm formation. The biofilm thickness might have opposed substrate diffusion and a low supply of oxygen which resulted in intense competition between nitrifying bacteria (AOB and NOB) and denitrifying bacteria (HDB).   Table 1   shows a summary of selected previous research on MABR systems demonstrating SND pro -  cesses and the major operating parameters that can influence the SND process.  3.   Other nitrogen removal pathways  3.1.   Partial nitrification and denitrification (PND) pathway  Another innovative nitrogen removal pathway within MABR is par -  tial nitrification-denitrification (PND). The strategy ( Fig. 2 ) involves the accumulation of AOB within the reactor to favour nitrite production, while suppressing the growth of NOB. The inhibition of NOB thereby prevents the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in the reactors [ 49 , 50 ]. Under anoxic conditions, denitrifying bacteria use organic carbon source to convert the nitrite that is generated into nitrogen gas. During denitrifi -  cation, the nitrite acts as the electron acceptor and the organic carbon as the electron donor [ 51 ].  The accumulation of nitrite is regulated by maintaining conditions that inhibit the oxidation of nitrite [ 52 ]. Sulfide has been used as an inhibitor in MABR to achieve partial nitrification [ 47 ]. The proper control of the aeration pattern, pH, temperature, DO and substrate concentration and loading pattern can also supress the growth and ac -  tion of NOB [ 53 , 54 ]. The partial nitrification process reduces oxygen intake by 25 – 60 %, while the subsequent denitrification cuts down organic carbon requirement by 40 – 100 % [ 47 , 55 ]. Compared to con -  ventional nitrification-denitrification processes, PND is energy-efficient, achieving   higher   nitrogen   removal   efficiencies,   cutting   down   the requirement for external carbon sources and reducing sludge formation [ 50 , 51 , 56 ].  Presently, PND processes have been studied extensively in sequential batch reactors (SBR) [ 50 , 51 , 55 , 57 ] and other activated sludge systems  R.N. Vesuwe et al.

[ 49 , 58 , 54 , 59 ], using different strategies. However, there is limited studies on the use of PND for nitrogen removal in MABR [ 47 ]. This could be due to the challenges of achieving partial nitrification in the MABR biofilm as the counter-diffusion of oxygen and ammonium gives ample opportunity for both NOB and AOB to thrive in the biofilm [ 27 , 60 ] and NOB adaptability within the biofilm, which makes their suppression difficult [ 47 , 61 ]. The long SRT in MABR [ 62 ] also makes it challenging to rule out NOB [ 47 ]. However, despite the challenges, MABR has a unique structure and oxygen supply mechanism which can facilitate PND if well leveraged on. For example, the membranes used in MABR systems directly supply oxygen to the biofilms where the microorgan -  isms reside [ 37 , 63 ]. Intermittent aeration in MABR has also been shown to significantly suppress NOB in the biofilm, thereby achieving partial nitrification [ 64 ]. For partial nitrification, a key advantage of MABR is its ability to effectively manage the oxygen flux into the system inde -  pendent of liquid flow rates [ 52 ].

3.1.1.   NOB suppression strategies to enable MABR   –   PND  Although long-term suppression of NOB is challenging, some re -  searchers have proposed mechanisms such as control of aeration pres -  sure [ 65 ] and low DO [ 1 , 66 ] to retard the growth of NOBs. For example, Huang et al. [ 26 ] reported a higher abundance of NOB ( Nitrospira)   at increasing DO levels (from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/L). Thus, to suppress such bacteria, the MABR reactor should be operated at lower DO. Generally, NOBs have a low affinity for oxygen compared to AOBs. As such, NOBs can be outcompeted at low DO concentrations of 0.4 to 0.6 mg/L [ 66 ]. Furthermore, NOB activities are usually restrained by relatively higher temperatures (30 – 35   ◦ C), high ammonia concentrations ( ≥   6.5 mg/L), and alkaline pH (pH of   ≥ 7.9) conditions [ 67 , 68 ]. Additionally, it has been reported that zero positive aeration pressure and higher ammo -  nium loading suppressed NOB activities by establishing an imbalance between substrate and oxygen in the MABR [ 65 ].  3.1.2.   Operational parameters and strategies for achieving PND in MABR systems  Partial nitrification stability in MABRs can be maintained by strate -  gically suppressing NOB activity while promoting AOB growth. This is achieved through precise DO control (typically 0.2 – 0.5 mg/L) that ex -  ploits AOB ’ s higher oxygen affinity, controlled biofilm thickness that creates steeper oxygen gradients, intermittent aeration to prevent NOB adaptation, free ammonia inhibition and regular monitoring of nitrite accumulation rates.  Studies have involved the use of various strategies to selectively oxidize ammonia to nitrite. Han et al. [ 47 ] introduced the innovative approach of combining low oxygen supply rate (with DO of 0.1 mg/L at a pressure of 50 Kpa) and the addition of sulfide to selectively suppress NOB. The lab-scale setup used synthetic wastewater in a 3 L reactor with influent 50 to 100 mg N/L of ammonium. The reactor operated in seven stages for 513 d at a temperature of 30   ◦ C while the pH was kept between 7.5 and 8.5 and HRT of 10 h. Their study concluded that the combined strategy notably inhibited NOBs in the biofilm (with relative abundance below 1 %). In another study, Lan et al. [ 69 ] implemented partial nitrification and anoxic/aerobic denitrification in MABR by regulating the pH and DO. The 6 L reactor (which ran in three stages) was kept at a temperature of 20   ◦ C and HRT of 24 h while adjusting the pH (between 7.5 and 9.5), DO (0 – 1 mg/L, 1 – 2 mg/L and 2 – 4 mg/L) and C/N ratio (0 – 3, 4 – 7 and 8 – 10). Their results indicated that the optimum param -  eters were pH 9, 1 – 2 mg/L of DO, and C/N ratio of 4 – 7, achieving nitrite accumulation rate of 77.7 %, average organic removal rate of 324 g COD/m 3 /d and total nitrogen removal rate of 48 g N/m 3 /d. Wang et al. [ 70 ] used the free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) control strategies to achieve partial nitrification in a sequencing batch MABR. The lab-scale 4.1   L reactor (containing synthetic wastewater) was operated in six stages for 544 d with intermittent aeration at a pressure of 2.5 kPa. Other parameters were varied (HRT of 24 h and 48 h, pH between 4 and 6 and influent ammonium of 200, 100 and 50 mg N/L) within the stages. Their result indicated that the higher influent (200 mg N/L)   could   maintain   partial   nitrification   using   relatively   low   FA (0.4 – 2.2 mg N/L) to suppress NOB in the biofilm. The lower influent (about 100 mg N/L) required FNA suppression strategies and FNA completely eliminated NOB in the biofilm, thereby stabilising partial nitrification. However, longer HRT was required in the bubbleless MABR for FNA concentration to be high enough to suppress NOB. Longer HRT of 36 – 48 h can reduce the pH, thereby increasing the concentration of FNA [ 70 ].  The small and modular design of MABRs provides a highly flexible, effective, and space-saving method for enabling PND. Treatment plants can incorporate the membrane modules in a compact manner, perfectly fitting into environments with limited space [ 71 , 72 ] without affecting the stratification of aerobic and anoxic zones. This allows PND proced -  ures to be implemented where conventional systems might not fit in. Because MABRs are modular, increasing capacity is simple and would not require a lot of extra room. The modular design also lowers the possibility of full nitrification which would impair PND efficiency, by making it simpler to separate and target particular zones for partial nitrification and denitrification. This is possible because interruptions or variations in one module are less likely to affect the total PND perfor -  mance as each module functions somewhat independently.  3.1.3.   Microbial community structure in MABR   –   PND systems  The   distinct   oxygen   supply   mechanism   in   MABRs   contributes significantly to the specialized and stratified microbial community for PND. The microbial population is made up of a wide variety of bacteria that are essential to the removal of nitrogen, such as denitrifying bac -  teria,   NOB   and   AOB.   However,   achieving   PND   requires   selective enrichment of specific bacterial genera. The AOBs that dominate the biofilm   during   PND   are   Nitrosomonas,   Nitrosospira   and   Candidatus Nitrosoglobus   while the common denitrifying bacteria are   Paracoccus ,  Pseudomonas ,   Thauera ,   Azoarcus,   Dechloromonas   ([ 47 , 73 ];   [ 70 , 74 ]). Despite being undesired in PND, NOBs such as   Nitrospira   and   Nitrobacter  [ 47 , 70 , 75 ] might exist and need to be managed. The study by Wang et al. [ 70 ] showed that exposure to FNA affected the relative abundance of AOBs and NOBs. The NOB ( Nitrospira)   decreased gradually from 10.3 % to 0.56 % after seven weeks of FNA intensified operation, but the AOB ( Nitrosomonas ) increased from 5.9 % to14.8 %, meaning that the AOB had stronger adaptation than NOB under high concentration of FNA.  3.2.   Partial nitrification /anammox (PNA)  An emerging area of focus in MABR technology development is the optimization of integrated MABR – anammox systems, particularly those facilitating the PNA pathway for advanced nitrogen removal ( Fig. 3 ). In these systems, gas distribution and the resulting oxygen gradients are critical to shaping microbial population dynamics responsible for the success of the process. AOB dominate near the membrane where oxygen concentrations are highest, NOB typically inhabit mid-biofilm zones with lower oxygen levels, and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) thrive in the oxygen-depleted outer layers, where they facili -  tate the anammox process. This microbially stratified biofilm structure underpins one of the most energy-efficient and sustainable nitrogen removal strategies currently available, with strong potential for appli -  cation across a broad spectrum of wastewater types [ 76 ].  The anammox process involves two primary steps: an initial 50% partial oxidation of influent ammonia to nitrite under aerobic conditions (Eq.   (4) ) by AOBs, and the subsequent conversion of the remaining ammonia to   nitrogen gas under   anaerobic condition by   anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing   bacteria   (AnAOB)   using   nitrite   as   the   electron acceptor (Eq.   (5) ). Moreover, the counter-diffusional transport of elec -  tron donors and acceptors within the system allows for independent control of oxygen and ammonia loadings, enabling the anammox pro -  cess optimization [ 77 ]. The overall stoichiometric relationship for PNA process is represented in Eq.   (6) .  Equations for partial nitrification/anammox  NH 4 +   +   1 . 5 O 2   → NO 2     +   H 2 O   +   2H +   (4)  NH 4 +   +   1 . 32 NO 2     → 1 . 02 N 2   +   0 . 26 NO 3     +   2 H 2 O   (5)  NH 4 +   +   0 . 8 5 O 2 → 0 . 11 NO 3     +   0 . 445 N 2   +   1 . 13H +   +   1 . 43 H 2 O   (6)  NOBs, are particularly undesirable in anammox process as they compete with AnAOB for nitrite and with AOB for oxygen. [ 61 ]. When competition between AOBs and NOBs abound in the system, the chal -  lenge becomes identifying mechanisms that can selectively enrich AOBs while effectively suppressing NOBs. Achieving this requires strategies grounded in a thorough understanding of the biokinetics of AOB, NOB, anammox bacteria and the underlying biological and environmental mechanisms within the MABR biofilm. Whereas AOB/NOB competition has been extensively studied in conventional co-diffusion biofilms fewer studies have focused on AOB/NOB dynamics within counter-diffusion  R.N. Vesuwe et al.

biofilms characteristics of MABR [ 55 ]. This gap in knowledge highlights the need for further investigation to better understand and optimize long-term PNA in MABRs.  3.2.1.   Advancing the application of MABR   –   PNA systems  Generally, research on MABR-PNA systems has focused on high- strength wastewater with influent nitrogen concentrations above 100 mg N/L, as these conditions are ideal for nitrogen removal via the PNA pathway, due to the in-situ formation of free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) [ 7 , 76 , 78 ]. But more recently, the scope has expanded to encompass a broader range of wastewater types and exploration of operational control strategies to facilitate the creation of PNA support -  ing condition within the MABR [ 15 , 76 , 79 , 80 ]. Augusto et al. [ 81 ] demonstrated the potential of MABR to rapidly establish single-stage PNA under mainstream condition, effectively overcoming the chal -  lenge of prolonged start-up periods that have traditionally limited the broader application of anammox processes in wastewater treatment. Similarly, Bunse et al. [ 5 ] demonstrated that PNA processes can be achieved in MABR under mainstream wastewater conditions using intermittent aeration. Models have also been applied to explore the potential of developing PNA in biofilm reactors. For example, Park et al. [ 82 ] utilized a multi-species nitrifying biofilm model (MSNBM) to identify conditions that promote or inhibit nitrite accumulation, a pre -  cursor to partial nitrification and assessed the effectiveness of these conditions in continuous flow biofilm reactors (CFBRs). Similarly, Ma et al. [ 83 ]. employed a pH-explicit 1-D MSNBM to provide experimental evidence demonstrating that intermittent aeration enhances efficient nitritation in MABR systems. With reported energy savings from MABR- PNA process exceeding 70 % [ 76 ], its optimization will be pivotal in addressing the global demand for efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater management systems. Consequently, research efforts are increasingly concentrated on advancing and refining this process.  3.2.2.   NOB suppression strategies to enable MABR   –   PNA  Inhibitory and kinetic-based mechanisms that have been reported to suppress NOB and establish PNA in MABRs under mainstream condi -  tions, include lumen pressure control, intermittent aeration and signif -  icantly low DO concentration operation [ 5 , 6 , 60 , 84 ], use of acid-tolerant AOB [ 73 ], combination of low DO, pH control, and sulfide addition [ 47 ], regulating   biofilm   scouring   intensity,   and   temperature   control [ 79 , 80 , 84 , 85 ]. Decreasing DO concentrations in both the bulk liquid and in the biofilm, either through adjustment of intramembrane pressure, intermittent aeration, or reduced DO operation is aimed at influencing the competition between AOB and NOB, leveraging their oxygen affin -  ities. Since microbial competition within the MABR biofilm is governed by kinetic parameters, AOB with higher oxygen affinity outcompete NOB for oxygen, effectively limiting NOB proliferation [ 1 ]. This aligns with the findings of Lu et al. [ 60 ], who reported that low DO ( < 0.1 mg/ L) can initiate and sustain partial nitritation in MABRs. Temperature also significantly influences microbial activity in wastewater treatment systems   [ 86 ].   For   example,   the   maximum   specific   growth   rate   of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) has been observed to exceed that of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) at temperatures above 20   ◦ C [ 87 ]. Operating at elevated temperatures (30   ◦ C to 40   ◦ C) has also been re -  ported to promote stable nitrite accumulation in wastewater treatment systems [ 80 ]. Furthermore, as high temperatures reduce oxygen solu -  bility, potentially lowering DO levels, this creates favourable conditions for anammox bacteria, whose optimal growth temperature also falls  Fig. 3.   Partial nitrification and anammox (PNA) in a single-stage MABR.  R.N. Vesuwe et al.   Journal   of   Water   Process   Engineering   74   (2025)   107758  7
within the 30   ◦ C to 40   ◦ C range [ 80 ]. FA and FNA, on the other hand, have demonstrated the ability to selectively inhibit NOB [ 70 , 78 , 82 ], with FNA recognized as one of the most effective agents for NOB sup -  pression [ 106 ]. Finally, MABR stratified biofilm, with high microbial density is conducive for the retention of anammox bacteria [ 5 ]. By harnessing the high nitrite affinity of anammox bacteria and their ability to thrive in anaerobic environment, PNA offers enhanced potential for stable nitrogen removal and long-term operation.  3.2.3.   Microbial community structure in MABR   –   PNA systems  The effectiveness of the PNA process fundamentally depends on the establishment and maintenance of a stratified microbial community within the biofilm matrix. This unique microbial community structure is influenced   by   multiple   factors   including   wastewater   composition, inoculum   characteristics,   and   operational   parameters   [ 5 , 28 , 60 , 80 ]. Within PNA systems, at least four primary microbial functional groups have been reported to coexist in distinct biofilm layers, each occupying niches defined by substrate availability and oxygen concentration gra -  dients [ 1 , 60 ]. Zhao et al. [ 75 ] characterized the spatial distribution of functional microorganisms in a plug-flow MABR system treating syn -  thetic   wastewater.   Their   analysis   revealed   that   AOB   populations (dominated by   Nitrosomonas   spp.) concentrated near the membrane- biofilm interface where oxygen availability was highest. The AnAOB community comprising   Candidatus   Brocadia,   Candidatus   Jettenia, and  Candidatus   Anammoxoglobus established deeper within the biofilm where oxygen was depleted but nitrite from AOB activity remained accessible. The authors observed that oxygen concentration gradients and organic carbon availability significantly influenced the relative abundance and spatial arrangement of these populations throughout the reactor. In another study, Chen et al. [ 65 ] focused on NOB suppression using low-pressure, for mainstream wastewater treatment documented the persistence of specific functional groups despite operational ma -  nipulations. They identified   Nitrosomonas   as the predominant AOB genus, while   Nitrospira   and   Nitrobacter   constituted the main NOB pop -  ulations.   The   heterotrophic   denitrifying   community   primarily comprised   Denitratisoma   and   Comamonas   genera. Among AnAOB,   Can -  didatus   Brocadia dominated in the system. Multiple studies have also confirmed consistent patterns in the community structure of successful MABR-PNA systems, with   Nitrosomonas   consistently emerging as the dominant AOB genus,   Nitrospira   as the primary NOB competitor, and  Candidatus   Brocadia   as   the   most   frequently   observed   AnAOB [ 5 , 37 , 47 , 79 ]. The relative abundance of these populations, however, exhibits significant variability depending on operational conditions.  4.   Biofilm thickness and nitrous oxide (N ₂ O) emission  Biofilm thickness in MABR plays a key role in oxygen transfer, sub -  strate diffusion, and the microbial community. For example, although a thin biofilm enhances substrate diffusion, it may not provide sufficient microbial activity for pollutant removal. On the other hand, a thick biofilm restricts oxygen diffusion into the inner layers, resulting in incomplete substrate degradation and reduced overall performance [ 88 ]. Moreover, researchers have linked microbial interaction, COD removal rates, substrate diffusion, microbial ecology, and nitrification to biofilm thickness [ 4 , 88 , 89 ]. Different researchers have reported various optimal biofilm thicknesses for pollutant removal from MABR systems. For example, Li et al. [ 90 ] used an optimal thickness of 1.6 mm (about 0.06 in) which achieved 98.6 % COD removal while Wei et al., [ 91 ]) worked with a thickness of 0.5 mm (about 0.02 in) which required an additional increase in oxygen pressure to achieve COD removal effi -  ciency of 77.5 %. Although it is challenging to maintain an optimal biofilm thickness, which will minimize biomass loss as well as promote mass and oxygen transfer, an optimal biofilm thickness management strategy should focus on eliminating biomass via erosion instead of biomass loss via sloughing [ 4 ].  Controlling biofilm thickness in MABR systems presents a significant challenge due to the dynamic nature of biofilm growth and detachment processes. The primary challenge in controlling biofilm thickness lies in the complex interplay between biological, chemical, and physical pro -  cesses within the MABR. The growth of the biofilm is influenced by various factors, including nutrient availability, oxygen concentration, hydraulic shear forces, and the composition of the microbial commu -  nity. Additionally, the rate of biofilm detachment, which occurs due to shear forces or sloughing, further complicates the control of biofilm thickness.  One of the critical issues is the spatial heterogeneity of biofilms in MABR systems. The biofilm ’ s structure can vary significantly across the membrane surface, leading to uneven oxygen and substrate distribution. This heterogeneity can result in localized regions of oxygen depletion, where anaerobic conditions prevail, potentially leading to the produc -  tion of undesirable by-products such as nitrous oxide. Understanding the factors that contribute to biofilm heterogeneity and developing strate -  gies   to   mitigate   its   impact   is   essential   for   optimizing   MABR performance.  Various strategies have been proposed to control biofilm thickness in MABR systems, ranging from operational adjustments to advanced en -  gineering solutions. For example, a recent study by Wei et al. [ 92 ] employed scouring assisted by computational fluid dynamics to control outer biofilm in a sequencing batch MABR treating low carbon/nitrogen wastewater. Airflow into MABR systems can greatly impact shearing conditions in the bulk liquid, and therefore, controlling air flow is another strategy that has been used to control biofilm. For instance, Lakshminarasimman et al. [ 93 ] reported a higher thickness of about 819   μ m when the airflow was lower (4.5 L/m 2 h) compared to a thickness of 285 – 667   μ m when the airflow was higher (6 L/m 2 h) in a full-scale MABR system treating municipal wastewater. Another approach in -  volves using an antifouling tactic known as quorum quenching (QQ) bacteria such as   Klebsiella pneumoniae ,   Bacillus methylotrophicus ,   Achro -  mobacter xylosoxidans , and   Lysinibacillus fusiformis , and to control the biofilm thickness [ 94 ]. An additional promising strategy is periodic backwashing or chemical cleaning to remove excess biofilm and main -  tain an optimal thickness. However, the frequency and intensity of biofilm control strategies must be carefully balanced to avoid disrupting the   biofilm ’ s   microbial   community   and   compromising   reactor performance.  The population stratification and thickness of the biofilm has a sig -  nificant impact in producing varying rates of N ₂ O under similar bulk liquid conditions, and N 2 O production increases with biofilm thickness [ 95 ]. The oxygen and nutrient counter-diffusion in MABR creates an environment that allows production and build-up of nitrous oxide [ 96 ]. The unique redox conditions created by the MABR design has varying effects on N ₂ O formation in the biofilm, depending on the nitrogen removal pathway. The SND pathway produces the highest amount of N ₂ O, especially under low concentrations of DO and organic carbon source [ 96 ], leading to the accumulation of N 2 O. This occurs due to incomplete heterotrophic denitrification which is described as the main N 2 O sink within the biofilm [ 96 , 97 ], and the major route of N 2 O emis -  sion in wastewater treatment plants [ 98 ], as heterotrophic denitrifica -  tion depends on organic carbon source for energy [ 99 ]. Emission of N 2 O in the PND pathway is lower compared to the SND pathway as partial nitrification prevents the formation of nitrates, cutting down the de -  mand for organic carbon sources in the anoxic region for heterotrophic denitrification [ 47 ]. Since PNA bypasses the N 2 O producing steps and uses AnAOB for the denitrification process, N 2 O production is relatively low, even with low DO and organic carbon sources. Even though N 2 O production by AnAOB metabolism is not clear, the release of N 2 O is still possible since AnAOB co-exists with other nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the biofilm [ 100 ]. Considering the mechanism of N 2 O production in the biofilm, conditions such as changes or fluctuations in DO concentration (high to low), high ammonium loadings which accumulates intermedi -  ate products such as nitrite and hydroxylamine and limited electron donors significantly increase N 2 O production in the biofilm [ 101 ].  R.N. Vesuwe et al.   Journal   of   Water   Process   Engineering   74   (2025)   107758  8
Strategies to mitigate N 2 O production such as control of DO, mi -  crobial community structure, C/N ratio, temperature, HRT, SRT and pH [ 99 , 100 , 102 , 103 ] have been studied extensively in other wastewater treatment plants. However, there is limited data on N 2 O mitigation strategies in MABR. A study by N  ́ emeth et al. [ 96 ] controlled operational parameters such as oxygen supply, C/N ratio, dynamic loading condi -  tions in MABR. Their result indicated that total N 2 O increased with increasing air flow rate; an increase in COD/N ratio from 3.5 to 4.0 drastically reduced the concentration of off-gas N 2 O from 2000 ppm to below 600 ppm and reduced carbon source for denitrification increased the emission of N 2 O. A one-dimensional model-based study by X. Chen et al. [ 95 ] compared biofilm property settings with respect to their N 2 O production. The results showed that increasing biofilm thickness from 200 to 1000   μ m decreased nitrogen removal efficiency from 90.1 % to 87.1 %, while increasing the N 2 O production factor from 2.9 % to 4.4 %; the boundary layer thickness had no impact on both nitrogen removal efficiency and N 2 O production; an increase in the reduction factor of diffusivity from 0.2 to 0.9 increased nitrogen removal efficiency from 86.1 % to 89.7 % and decreased N 2 O production factor from 4.6 % to 3.2 %; biofilm discretization (an increase in the number of grid points) increased nitrogen removal efficiency from 88.1 % to 89.0 % and also increased N 2 O production factor from 3.0 % to 4.1 %. Another mathe -  matical model study by [ 104 ] presented a contrasting result that a thicker biofilm of 400 – 600   μ m led to a lower N 2 O production factor   <  0.13 %, due to AOB nitrification pathway (7.1 % – 9.3 %) and HB deni -  trification pathway (90.7 % – 92.9 %). The same study however, stated that hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) pathway and HB denitrification were more prevalent in the inner (0 – 160   μ m) and outer (290 – 350   μ m) zones of the MABR; concluding that biofilm thickness of 160 – 280   μ m is the optimal zone for N 2 O reduction. Regarding other parameters, the study concluded that the higher oxygen surface loading (2.913 g/m 2 /d), longer HRT (0.6 d), and lower influent COD (200 to 280 mg/L) sub -  stantially increased N 2 O production factor from 0.18 % to 3.3 %.  5.   Statistical analysis of operating conditions for ammonia removal  As shown in   Table 1 , several operating factors influence nitrogen removal efficiency via the SND pathway in MABR systems, including influent ammonia concentration, air pressure, DO, pH, temperature, C/ N ratio, HRT, and membrane surface area. These factors serve as key considerations   for   engineers   in   system   design,   reactor   feasibility  Fig. 4.   Principal component analysis a) scree plot and b) biplot of the eight factors that influence the SND pathway in MABR systems.  R.N. Vesuwe et al.

assessment, and effective management of MABR systems performing SND. The analysis of factors influencing nitrogen removal efficiency via the SND pathway in MABR systems began with outlier detection using Dixon ’ s r22 Ratio outlier test at a 0.05 significance level. To ensure accurate conclusions, three data points were removed: an influent ammonia concentration of 3000 mg/L, a DO concentration of 6 mg/L, and an HRT of 60 h (S1: supplementary document and   Table 1 ). This adjustment reduced the dataset to 51 data points for further analysis.  The principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the remaining 51 data points using Minitab software to explore and visu -  alize the data sets. This simplified the data interpretation by concen -  trating   on   the   principal   components   that   captured   the   underlying patterns   among   the   eight   considered   factors   that   contributed   to ammonia removal efficiency via the SND pathway in the MABR systems.  Fig. 4   a) shows the scree plot where the three components have eigen -  values higher than 1, and these three components account for 71.1 % of the variation in the data set (S2: supplementary document). As shown in  Fig. 4   b) and S2 (supplementary document), the first principal compo -  nent (PC1) accounted for 36 % of the total variance and the factors that correlated most with PC1 included HRT (0.521), temperature (0.402), influent ammonia concentration (0.369), and air pressure (0.315). The PC1 positively correlated with all four factors. Thus, an increase in these factors increases the value of PC1. Additionally, the first four principal components explain almost 82 % of the variation in the data set, of which PC1 contributed the biggest portion (S2: supplementary docu -  ment). Hence, some of the most important factors that influenced ni -  trogen removal efficiency via SND in the selected papers ( Table 1 ) could be among these four factors.  Since PCA results could not exactly conclude the most important factor influencing nitrogen removal efficiency via SND in MABR sys -  tems, other predictive analyses had to be performed. Therefore, pre -  dictive analysis using the CART ®   Regression method was performed to determine the most important factor among the eight evaluated factors regarding nitrogen removal efficiency via SND. Before CART ®   Regres -  sion analysis, two more outliers revealed from the outlier plot of PCA (S2:   supplementary   document)   were   removed   to   further   minimize misleading conclusions. Therefore, CART ®   Regression analysis was performed   on   the   remaining   49   data   sets.   According   to   CART ®  Regression analysis, pH was the most important factor (among the eight evaluated factors) which influenced nitrogen removal efficiency via SND in MABR systems ( Fig. 5 ). pH had a relative importance of 100 % (the most important predictor variable), and membrane surface area was the least important predictor variable for nitrogen removal via SND for the data set considered ( Fig. 5 ). Influent ammonia concentration was 54.3 % as important as pH, while the rest of the predictor variables were below 50 % as important as pH ( Fig. 5 ).  Therefore, two-dimensional (2-D) surface contour plots were con -  structed to evaluate how nitrogen removal efficiency via the SND pathway interacts with the first five important factors i.e., pH, influent ammonia   concentration,   temperature,   HRT,   and   DO   concentration ( Fig. 5 ). As shown in   Fig. 6   and the optimal tree diagram (S3: supple -  mentary document), the higher nitrogen removal efficiency was gener -  ally predicted at a higher pH between 6.65 and 8.25; moderate influent ammonia concentration of   < 82.5 mg/L; higher temperature   > 18   ◦ C but  < 24.5   ◦ C; DO concentration   > 0.65 mg/L for the HRT ranging from 5 to 15 h. Precisely, the contour lines of influent ammonia concentration of  < 75 mg/L at pH ranging between 7 and 8 corresponded to higher ni -  trogen removal efficiency ( Fig. 6 a). Focusing on   Fig. 6 b, the higher ni -  trogen removal efficiency was expected at pH between 6 and 9 for temperatures ranging between 18 and 24   ◦ C. For the interaction be -  tween pH and HRT ( Fig. 6 c), the higher nitrogen removal efficiency was predicted at pH between 6.2 and 8.3 for lower HRT of   < 8 h as well as at higher HRT of about 12 – 15 h for neutral pH conditions (7 – 7.5). Lastly, regions of neutral pH close to 7 at varying DO concentrations ranging from 0.15 mg/L to 3.5 mg/L tallied to higher nitrogen removal effi -  ciency ( Fig. 6 d).  However, lower nitrogen removal efficiency corresponded to acidic pH ( ≤   6.65), higher influent ammonia concentration ( >   90 mg/L), very low temperature ( <   18   ◦ C), very low HRT ( <   4 h) and low DO con -  centration ( <   0.65 mg/L) ( Fig. 6   and optimal tree diagram of S3: sup -  plementary document). Additionally, a higher DO concentration of about 2.5 mg/L at higher pH ranging from 7.5 to 9 also tallied with low nitrogen removal efficiency ( Fig. 6 d).  5.1.   Regression model for estimating nitrogen removal efficiency  Multiple regression analysis was conducted on the first five impor -  tant factors ( Fig. 5 ), i.e., pH, influent ammonia concentration, temper -  ature, HRT, and DO concentration using the 49 data sets to generate a second-order polynomial equation, fit the model, and optimize the ni -  trogen removal efficiency. The second-order polynomial model gener -  ated in the current study using Minitab software is given by Eq.   (7) :  Fig. 5.

The R 2   value of 0.8042 implied that the model explains 80.42 % of the variability in nitrogen removal efficiency via the SND pathway in MABR systems within the studied literature values domain (S4: supplementary document). The predicted and measured nitrogen removal efficiency were close (S4 of the supplementary docu -  ment). Besides, the relationship between nitrogen removal efficiency and the five important factors (pH, influent ammonia concentration, temperature, HRT, and DO concentration) was statistically significant since the   p -value was   < 0.1 (S4: supplementary document). Additionally, based on the generated model (Eq.   (4) ), the optimal operating condi -  tions for maximum nitrogen removal efficiency via SND in MABR sys -  tems were alkaline pH of 9.7, influent ammonia concentration of 48.9 mg/L, temperature of 16   ◦ C, HRT of 24 h, and DO concentration of 0.96 mg/L ( Fig. 7 ). The developed model applies to a given range of specific values of predictor variables, i.e., pH ranging from 4.5 to 10, influent ammonia concentration of 20 to 170 mg/L, temperature of 16 to 31   ◦ C, HRT of 4 to 24 h and DO of 0.1 to 4 mg/L for ammonia removal in varying wastewater treatment using MABR systems.  6.   Conclusion  MABR is a promising wastewater treatment technology due to its increased oxygen usage efficiency, low space demand, lower carbon requirement, reduced carbon footprint, and higher biodegradation rate. Nitrogen removal in MABR can be through SND, PND or PNA pathways. The PNA and PND pathways reduce oxygen consumption by 25 – 60 % and the demand for organic carbon by 40 – 100 %. Precise control of specific operational parameters is essential for achieving effective ni -  trogen removal in MABR systems through various pathways. There is a significant relationship between nitrogen removal efficiency and factors such as pH, influent ammonia concentration, temperature, HRT, and DO concentration. A statistical analysis of operating conditions reported in the   literature   indicated   that   the   optimal   operating   conditions   for maximum nitrogen removal efficiency via SND in MABR systems were alkaline pH of 9.70, influent ammonia concentration of 48.9 mg/L, temperature of 16   ◦ C, HRT of 24 h, and DO concentration of 0.96 mg/L. In addition to the parameters in SND, further control strategies to suc -  cessfully achieve partial nitrification are required for PNA and PND. Strategies such as inhibitor addition, limited oxygen supply, intermit -  tent aeration, temperature control, regulation of FA/FNA and organic carbon ratios have been used. Future research may focus on biofilm thickness control and mitigation of N 2 O emissions in SND, strategies to increase the growth of microorganisms that favour partial nitrification while inhibiting nitrite oxidation and strategies to maintain optimal pH in PND, and research on strategies to increase and sustain anammox bacterial development in biofilms for PNA.

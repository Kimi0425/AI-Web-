This study utilized mem -  brane aerated biofilm reactors (MABRs) with bubbleless aeration to promote ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and integrated multiple selective pressures to suppress nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), including zero-seed sludge start-up, low dissolved oxygen ( < 0.4 mg/L), and inhibition by free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA). MABRs achieved 1.50 – 1.93 times higher ammonium removal rates than conventional aerated biofilm reactors (CABRs), regardless of high- or low-strength ammonium wastewater (500 and 50 mg NH 4  + -N/L), attributed to enhanced biofilm growth facilitated by membrane aeration. In the ammonium-rich wastewater scenario (500 mg NH 4  + -N/L), thinner biofilms were observed compared to mainstream wastewater (50 mg NH 4  + - N/L), likely due to the environmental filtering effect induced by FA and FNA. Importantly, this effect selectively enriched   Nitrosomonas   (13.56 % – 18.61 %) while outcompeting   Nitrispira   (0.02 % – 0.04 %), allowing stable nitritation for over 110 days. In the mainstream wastewater case, the zero-seed sludge strategy promoted AOB colonization as pioneer species, which preferentially consumed oxygen (like an ecological priority effect), leading to rapid nitritation initiation within 10 days. However, mainstream nitritation lasted only 10 – 20 days, primarily due to a lack of FA and FNA-like inhibitory factors that effectively suppress NOB. The findings elucidate the benefits of membrane aeration-driven AOB promotion and highlight the importance of continuous  in-situ   environmental filtering of NOB (e.g., FA and FNA-induced selective pressures) in ensuring stable nitrite shunt operation.  1.   Introduction  Shortcut biological nitrogen removal processes, such as nitritation- denitritation and partial nitritation-anammox, offer sustainable path -  ways   for   wastewater   treatment,   advancing   efforts   toward   carbon neutrality   [1 – 3] . Robust nitritation, characterized by the stable sup -  pression of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), is essential for achieving shortcut biological nitrogen removal processes   [4] . Various strategies have been proposed to effectively inhibit NOB, such as low dissolved oxygen (DO), high temperature, short sludge retention time, and inter -  mittent aeration   [5 – 8] . Among these, low DO control (0.1 – 1.0 mg/L) is considered the most practical approach from an engineering perspective  [5,9 – 13] .   Essentially,   this   strategy   exploits   the   ecological   niche differentiation between ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and NOB in oxygen utilization, where AOB exhibits a higher oxygen affinity than NOB (i.e.,   K O,AOB   <   K O,NOB )   [14] . While reducing DO levels in the bulk liquid to a specific threshold effectively suppresses NOB, it can also negatively impact AOB activity, ultimately decreasing the overall pro -  cess efficiency   [15] .  An advanced approach for aeration control to facilitate nitritation is the use of membrane aerated biofilm reactors (MABRs)   [16] . MABRs employ oxygen-permeable membranes to deliver oxygen to biofilms that naturally form on the membrane surface   [17] . This membrane aeration method creates a distinct oxygen gradient within the MABR biofilm, with DO concentrations decreasing from the inner to the outer layers; for instance, the DO concentration at the membrane-biofilm interface may  *   Corresponding author.

exceed 8 mg/L, whereas it could approach 0 mg/L at the biofilm-bulk liquid interface   [18,19] . Recent studies suggest that high DO concen -  tration can promote AOB activity, thereby increasing the disparity be -  tween AOB and NOB activity, which also helps mitigate the unwanted prevalence of NOB   [20 – 23] . Consequently, it is hypothesized that this oxygen gradient — high DO concentration in the inner biofilm layers, coupled with low DO concentration in the outer layers and bulk liq -  uid — may   facilitate   a   stable   and   high-rate   nitritation   process   by encouraging AOB growth while limiting NOB survival.  Establishment of nitritation in MABRs has been reported, with stable suppression of NOB maintained over periods ranging from 40 to 200 days   [24,16,25 – 28] . However, once NOB is established within biofilms, their washout becomes challenging due to the protective barrier pro -  vided by the biofilm structure   [28,29] . This challenge persists even when the oxygen loading is designed to match the ammonium loading to avoid over-aeration   [30] , or when treating high-strength ammonium wastewater   ( ＞   200   mg   NH 4  + -N/L),   which   inherently   causes   free ammonia (FA) inhibition   [28,31] . In practical operation, the primary source of NOB is often from the inoculum, e.g., conventional nitrifying activated sludge. While low DO control can initially suppress NOB, adaption or species shifts within the NOB community (e.g., from   r - strategist   Nitribacter   to   K -strategist   Nitrospira ) may occur over time  [32 – 34] . Consequently, minimizing the introduction of NOB, particu -  larly during the early stage of biofilm formation, is crucial for ensuring sustained nitritation. A zero-seed sludge (i.e., without inoculum) strat -  egy may offer a promising approach to optimize nitritation in MABRs, thereby reducing the risk of NOB colonization in biofilms and facili -  tating more efficient and stable nitritation.  In light of these challenges, membrane aeration was introduced and a novel strategy based on the ecological principles of   “ priority effect ”   and  “ niche   differentiation ”   was   proposed   to   facilitate   nitritation.   This approach will employ a zero-seed sludge start-up method, allowing AOB to establish themselves as pioneer species within self-assembled biofilms and preferentially consume oxygen, thereby creating a selective pres -  sure that suppresses NOB growth near the biofilm base. Subsequently, maintaining low DO levels in the bulk liquid (DO BL ;   <   0.4 mg/L) further strengthens this selection pressure, inhibiting NOB proliferation within the outer layer. Simultaneously, membrane aeration is anticipated to promote AOB activity, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the nitritation process.  This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for enhancing nitritation. Two lab-scale MABRs were set up to treat wastewater containing low and high ammonium concentrations (50 and 500 mg NH 4  + -N/L), respectively. In parallel, two conventional aerated biofilm reactors (CABRs) with diffused aeration were established for comparative ones. The nitritation performance was assessed over a 120- day period. Moreover, the physicochemical and microbial characteris -  tics of the self-assembled MABR biofilms were examined using various techniques, e.g., scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and metagenomic sequencing. Finally, the mechanisms driving nitritation performance in MABRs were elucidated, along with a discussion on enhanced ammonium oxidation capacity in MABRs. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of MABR technology in the nitritation process and offer theoretical support for its application in both low- and high-strength ammonium wastewater treatment.  2.   Materials and methods  2.1.   Reactor configuration  A total of four lab-scale reactors, labeled MABR-1, CABR-1, MABR-2, and CABR-2, were operated for a period of 120 days ( Fig. S1 ). Each reactor has a working volume of 4.0 L and was equipped with a mem -  brane module (hollow-fiber membrane; 240 m 2 /m 3 ) ( Table S1 ). The membrane module in MABRs functioned as both an oxygen delivery system and a carrier for microbial growth. In contrast, in CABRs, the membrane module was exclusively used for biofilm carriers, with both ends sealed. For oxygen supply, CABRs relied on an air stone diffuser located at the bottom of the reactor.  2.2.   Reactor operation  No inoculum was introduced into the reactors, and nitrifying bac -  teria was originally sourced from tap water   [35] . Synthetic wastewater was supplied to each reactor, with an influent ammonium concentration of approximately 50 mg NH 4  + -N/L for MABR-1 and CABR-1, representing low-strength   ammonium-containing   wastewater   (e.g.,   municipal wastewater), and approximately 500 mg NH 4  + -N/L for MABR-2 and CABR-2, representing high-strength ammonium-containing wastewater (e.g., landfill leachate) ( Text S1 ).  The hydraulic retention time was 6.1 – 12.5 h for MABR-1 and CABR, and 27.9 – 44.4 h for MABR-2 and CABR-2. To improve mass transfer, each reactor was equipped with a peristaltic pump (BT100-2 J, RongBai, China) to maintain liquid recirculation at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. The air was continuously supplied to each reactor by an air pump (CT-101, SUNSUN). In MABRs, cross-flow aeration was employed, with airflow rate and air pressure controlled at the designed values using a flow meter and exhaust valve. For CABRs, the airflow rate was regulated using the flow meter, and the air pressure was maintained at 10 kPa. Detailed variations in the airflow rate (10 – 20 mL/min) and the aeration pressure (5 – 10 kPa) are provided in   Fig. S2 .  2.3.   Analytical methods  2.3.1.   Water quality analysis  Samples of wastewater were collected regularly from the reactors and immediately filtered through 0.45   μ m Millipore filters. The con -  centrations of NH 4  + , NO 2  – , NO 3  – , mixed liquor suspended solids, and mixed   liquid   volatile   suspended   solids   (MLVSS)   were   determined following the Chinese National Standard Methods   [36] . DO and pH levels were recorded using a DO meter (WTW oxi3315, Germany) and a pH meter (WTW pH3310, Germany), respectively. Calculations for ammonium removal efficiency (ARE), nitrite accumulation ratio (NAR), ammonium removal rate (ARR), oxygen utilization efficiency (OUE), free ammonia (FA), and free nitrous acid (FNA) are provided in   Text S2 .  2.3.2.   Pristine membrane and biofilm characterization  The surface and cross-sectional structures of the pristine membrane were analyzed using SEM (ZEISS, Gemini 300) and micro-computed tomography   (micro-CT;   ZEISS   Xradia520;   resolution:   1   um/pixel), respectively. On day 90, biofilm samples were collected by cutting approximately 1 cm of the membrane, which were then analyzed using SEM and CLSM. SEM could visualize the surface and cross-sectional morphology of biofilms   [37] . To distinguish live and dead cells, the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kits (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, US) were employed, and imaging was performed using CLSM (FA1000, Olympus, Japan) ( Text S3 ). Additionally, biofilm samples were scraped from membrane surfaces for the extraction and quantification of extra -  cellular polymeric substances (EPS) ( Text S4 ).  2.3.3.   Metagenomic sequencing  Biofilm samples were collected in triplicate from the membrane surface for metagenomic sequencing. DNA extraction and sequencing were   carried   out   by   Majorbio   Bio-pharm   Technology   Co.,   Ltd. (Shanghai, China) ( Text S5 ). The raw sequencing data was submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (project number: PRJNA1097761).   Microbial   molecular   ecological   networks   (MENs) were   constructed   using   the   molecular   ecological   network   analysis pipeline ( http://ieeg2.ou.edu/MENA ), employing the random matrix theory approach, and visualized using the interactive platform Gephi (v0.10.1).

3.   Results  3.1.   Nitritation establishment and stability in MABRs and CABRs  The long-term performance of MABR and CABR systems in treating low- and high-strength ammonium wastewater (50 and 500 mg NH 4  + -N/ L)   was   evaluated   over   120   days   ( Fig.   1 ).   These   four   bioreactors, employing the zero-seed sludge start-up strategy coupled with low DO BL  control,   exhibited   stable   nitritation   when   treating   ammonium-rich wastewater; however, nitritation collapsed when treating low-strength ammonium   wastewater   ( Fig.   1 a-d).   Notably,   MABRs   outperformed CABRs, showing higher ammonium removal rate (ARR) and oxygen utilization efficiency (OUE) ( p   <   0.001;   Fig. 1 e), highlighting their potential   for   efficient   ammonium   removal   and   energy   savings   in wastewater treatment.  For the first 10 days, both MABR and CABR systems exhibited min -  imal ammonium removal due to the absence of seed sludge ( Fig. 1 a-d). Correspondingly, DO BL   concentrations remained high at 6 – 8 mg/L ( Fig. S3 a), suggesting weak oxygen consumption and a limited popula -  tion of aerobic microorganisms. From day 11 onward, ammonium removal became noticeable and remained stable between days 61 and 120, with ARRs of 0.7   ±   0.02, 0.5   ±   0.01, 1.6   ±   0.02, and 0.8   ±   0.03 g N/m 2 /d   in   MABR-1,   CABR-1,   MABR-2,   and   CABR-2,   respectively ( Fig. 1 a-d). Meanwhile, DO BL   concentrations reached a stable state, with values of 0.3   ±   0.1, 0.9   ±   0.1, 0.1   ±   0.04, and 1.0   ±   0.01 mg/L for MABR-1, CABR-1, MABR-2, and CABR-2, respectively ( Fig. S3 a).

Initially, nitrite was the primary product of ammonium oxidation in all reactors ( Fig. 1 a-d), which was attributed to the preferential colo -  nization of AOB on the membrane surfaces. Although tap water con -  tained both AOB and NOB   [38] , AOB could achieve a faster growth rate compared to NOB due to the substrate characteristics (ample NH 4  +   and limited NO 2  – ) and the operating temperature (approximately 30 ◦ C)   [39] . However, as the operation progressed, reactors treating low-strength ammonium wastewater (MABR-1 and CABR-1; 50 mg NH 4  + -N/L) expe -  rienced a gradual decrease in effluent nitrite concentration, resulting in the collapse of nitritation (NAR   <   50 %) after day 21 in MABR-1 and day 38 in CABR-1, and ultimately shifting to complete nitrification ( Fig. 1 a, b). This decline occurred despite the low DO BL   concentrations in both systems (0.3   ±   0.1 in MABR-1 and 0.9   ±   0.1 in CABR-1;   Fig. S3 a). Additionally, MABR-1 displayed poorer nitritation performance than CABR-1 ( Fig. 1 e). These results were contrary to our expectations, sug -  gesting that the oxygen gradient within the counter-diffusional MABR biofilms may be less effective in sustaining stable nitritation than initially anticipated.  In   contrast,   the   reactors   treating   ammonium-rich   wastewater (MABR-2 and CABR-2; 500 mg NH 4  + -N/L) sustained stable nitritation throughout the operational period, achieving NAR values of 99.0   ±   1.1 % and 99.0   ±   0.6 % for MABR-2 and CABR-2, respectively ( Fig. 1 c, d). This robust nitritation may be attributed to high concentrations of FA and FNA in both systems, with concentrations exceeding 80 mg/L and 1.4 mg/L, respectively ( Fig. S3 b), surpassing the reported thresholds for NOB suppression (FA: 5 – 20 mg/L, FNA: 0.02 – 0.2 mg/L)   [40] . Achieving such inhibitory concentrations, however, was difficult in low-strength ammonium wastewater systems, where FA and FNA concentrations remained below 0.2 mg/L and approximately 0 mg/L in both MABR-1 and CABR-1, respectively.  Although both MABRs and CABRs exhibited similar effectiveness and limitations in operating nitritation, MABRs showed a higher capacity for ammonium removal. Specifically, compared to CABRs, ARRs in MABRs were approximately 1.5-fold higher when treating low-strength ammo -  nium wastewater (0.6   ±   0.1   vs.   0.4   ±   0.1 g N/m 2 /d) and 1.9-fold higher when treating high-strength ammonium wastewater (1.3   ±   0.4   vs.   0.7  ±   0.2 g N/m 2 /d) ( p   <   0.001,   Fig. 1 e). Additionally, the OUE in MABRs (MABR-1: 61.3   ±   15.1 %; MABR-2: 62.8   ±   5.9 %) was nearly double that observed in CABRs (CABR-1: 36.2   ±   8.6 %; CABR-2: 31.8   ±   5.6 %) ( p   <   0.001,   Fig. 1 e), suggesting the substantial energy-saving potential of MABRs   [41] .  3.2.   Physicochemical properties of MABR and CABR biofilms  3.2.1.   Biomass contents of biofilms  Digital and SEM images exhibited the successful attachment of bio -  films to membrane surfaces, with microbial aggregation on the mem -  brane surface in MABRs significantly greater than in CABRs ( Fig. 2 a-e). The biofilm thickness in MABR-1 and MABR-2 were 108   μ m and 42   μ m, respectively, compared to 58   μ m and 25   μ m in CABR-1 and CABR-2, respectively ( Fig. 2 b-e). The biomass concentration of biofilms was also measured, yielding values of 4541.7   ±   201.0, 3104.2   ±   118.3, 3000.0   ±   250.0, and 1625.0   ±   62.5 mg VSS/m 2   for MABR-1, CABR-1, MABR-2, and CABR-2, respectively ( Fig. 2 f). Clearly, MABR exhibited significantly higher biomass concentrations compared to CABR ( p   <  0.001,   Fig. 2 f), suggesting that MABRs provided more favorable condi -  tions for biofilm formation.  Intriguingly, reactors treating ammonium-rich wastewater (500 mg NH 4  + -N/L)   showed   a   lower   biofilm   thickness   and   biomass   content compared to those treating low-strength ammonium wastewater (50 mg NH 4  + -N/L)   ( Fig.   2 f),   despite   achieving   significantly   higher   ARRs ( Fig. 1 e). This result indicated that although the operational conditions in ammonium-rich wastewater systems are less conducive to microbial aggregation and proliferation, the nitrifying biofilms exhibited a higher metabolic activity, i.e., ammonium oxidation rate per unit biomass.  3.2.2.   EPS concentration and composition  EPS plays a crucial role in biofilm formation, providing a robust and adhesive matrix for microbial colonization   [42] . The EPS content in MABR biofilms was significantly higher than that in CABR biofilms ( p   <  0.001,   Fig. 2 g), consistent with the results of biomass concentration results ( Fig. 2 b-f). In terms of EPS composition, proteins were the dominant component in biofilms, accounting for 66.9 % – 88.1 % of the total EPS content ( Fig. 2 g). The protein concentration in MABR biofilm EPS was higher than that of CABR biofilm EPS ( Fig. 2 g), which is generally believed to be more hydrophobic than carbohydrates, pro -  moting microbial aggregation   [43] .  Additionally, the proportion of humic acid (HA) in the EPS of MABR biofilms was found to be lower than that in CABR biofilms ( Fig. S4 ). HA in microbial EPS typically originates from two main sources: adsorption from   wastewater   and   the   decomposition   of   microbial   necromass  [44,45] . Since synthetic carbon-free wastewater was utilized in this study, the HA in biofilm EPS likely originated from the decomposition of microbial necromass, suggesting a higher abundance of viable micro -  organisms in MABR biofilms compared to CABR biofilms. This obser -  vation is further supported by the higher live/dead bacteria ratios seen in MABR biofilms relative to CABR biofilms ( Section 3.3.1 ).  3.3.   Microbial properties of MABR and CABR biofilms  3.3.1.   Live/dead bacteria ratio  Confocal   laser   scanning   microscopy   (CLSM)   was   employed   to examine the three-dimensional spatial distribution of live and dead bacteria within typical biofilm samples from MABR and CABR systems ( Fig. 2 h). In MABR biofilms, live bacteria were widely distributed and evenly spread, with minimal dead bacteria present ( Fig. 2 h). In contrast, CABR biofilms exhibited a rough layer of live bacteria on the membrane surface, interspersed with noticeable clusters of dead bacteria ( Fig. 2 h). Quantitatively, the proportion of live bacteria in MABR biofilms (88 % –  90 %) was significantly greater than in CABR biofilms (73 % – 75 %) ( Fig. 2 h), indicating that MABRs created a more favorable environment for maintaining active nitrifying biofilms.  3.3.2.   Microbial community diversity and composition  Microbial community diversity and composition are essential for shaping microbial traits and functional roles of nitrifying biofilms, which were analyzed using metagenomic sequencing ( Fig. 3 a-c). The results revealed that the microbial diversity was significantly higher in MABR-1 and CABR-1 biofilms (50 mg NH 4  + -N/L) compared to MABR-2 and CABR-2 biofilms (500 mg NH 4  + -N/L), as evident by higher Ace, Shannoneven, and Shannon index values, along with lower Simpson index values in MABR-1 and CABR-1 biofilms ( Fig. 3 a and   Table S2 ).  In MABR-1 and CABR-1 biofilms, the predominant phyla were   Pro -  teobacteria ,   Chloroflexi ,   Bacteroidota , and   Acidobacteriota , which collec -  tively accounted for over 70 % of biofilm microbial communities ( Fig. 3 b). In contrast,   Proteobacteria   and   Bacteroidota   predominated in the MABR-2 and CABR-2 biofilms, comprising over 80 % of the micro -  bial population, while   Chloroflexi   and   Acidobacteriota   represented only small fractions (0.22 % – 1.34 % and 0.34 % – 0.51 %, respectively) ( Fig. 3 b). The observed decrease in microbial diversity and shift in mi -  crobial composition is likely attributed to the selective pressure from FA and FNA.  Further analysis of the top ten genera in each reactor (a total of twenty-five) revealed that   Nitrosomonas   and   Nitrospira   were the domi -  nant AOB and NOB, respectively, in all nitrifying biofilms ( Fig. 3 c and  Table S3 ). The relative abundance of   Nitrosomonas   in MABR-2 and CABR-2 biofilms treating ammonium-rich wastewater was 18.61 % and 13.56 %, respectively, approximately 4-fold higher than in MABR-1 and CABR-1 biofilms (4.53 % and 3.39 %, respectively) treating low-strength ammonium wastewater ( Fig. 3 c).  In contrast,   Nitrospira , a common NOB genus, was prevalent in MABR-1 and CABR-1 biofilms, with a relative abundance of 1.88 % and  J. Li et al.

5.89 %, respectively ( Fig. 3 c). However, its relative abundance was extremely low in the MABR-2 and CABR-2 biofilms, at 0.02 % and 0.04 %, respectively ( Fig. 3 c). This contributed to poor nitritation in MABR-1 and CABR-1, whereas MABR-2 and CABR-2 exhibited stable and robust nitritation with high NAR ( ＞   98 %) ( Fig. 1 e). In addition to   Nitro -  somonas , other bacteria such as   unclassified_f__Chitinophagaceae   (known for degrading organic compounds) and   unclassified_f__Xanthomonadaceae  (quorum sensing bacteria and EPS producer) was also enriched in MABR-2 and CABR-2 biofilms ( Fig. 3 c)   [46,47] , suggesting their ability to withstand stressful conditions (high FA and FNA concentrations).  Furthermore,   Nitrosomonas   exhibited a higher relative abundance in the MABR-1 biofilm (4.53 %) compared to the CABR-1 biofilm (3.39 %) ( Fig. 3 c), contributing to the superior ARR in MABR-1 (0.63   ±   0.13 g N/ m 2 /d) compared to CABR-1 (0.42   ±   0.09 g N/m 2 /d) ( p   <   0.001;   Fig. 1 e). A similar trend was observed in ammonium-rich wastewater treatment systems, where MABR-2 biofilm exhibited a higher relative abundance of   Nitrosomonas   (18.61 %) than the CABR-2 biofilm (13.56 %) ( Fig. 3 c), suggesting the MABRs more favorable for   Nitrosomonas   enrichment.  3.3.3.

analyzed ( Fig. 4 ). The microbial metabolic pathways at KEGG Level 3 in MABR and CABR biofilms were largely similar, including pathways such as   biosynthesis   of   secondary   metabolites,   microbial   metabolism   in diverse environments, and biosynthesis of amino acids ( Fig. 4 a). A comparative   analysis   of   nitrifying   biofilms   treating   low-strength ammonium wastewater (MABR-1 and CABR-1; 50 mg NH 4  + -N/L) and high-strength ammonium wastewater (MABR-2 and CABR-2; 500 mg NH 4  + -N/L)   revealed   a significant reduction   in   metabolic functional redundancy in the MABR-2 and CABR-2 biofilm ecosystems ( Fig. 4 b).  Specifically, in MABR-1 and CABR-1 biofilms, diverse microbial genera contributed to different metabolic pathways, whereas in MABR-2 and CABR-2 biofilms, metabolic processes were mainly driven by a restricted range of genera, primarily involving   Nitrosomonas ,   unclassi -  fied_f__Chitinophagaceae , and   unclassified_f__Xanthomonadacea   ( Fig. 4 b). For example, in the biosynthesis of amino acids pathway, several genera participated in the MABR-1 biofilm, e.g.,   Nitrosomonas   (5.40 %),   Nitro -  spira   (5.29 %),   unclassified_c__Anaerolineae   (12.10 %),   unclassified_c__ -  Blastocatellia   (10.72 %),   unclassified_f__Chitinophagaceae   (4.08 %), and  unclassified_o__Anaerolineales   (8.44 %). In contrast, this metabolism in the MABR-2 biofilm was primarily reliant on   Nitrosomonas   (17.67 %),  unclassified_f__Chitinophagaceae   (7.43 %), and   unclassified_f__Xanthomo -  nadaceae   (25.21 %) ( Fig. 4 b and   Table S4 ). This observed difference between MABR-1 and MABR-2 biofilms, as well as between CABR-1 and CABR-2 biofilms ( Fig. 4 b), indicates that under FA and FNA stress, the nitrifying   biofilm   ecosystems   became   increasingly   dependent   on   a smaller group of microbial genera to maintain essential metabolic functions.  3.3.4.   Microbial network interactions  Microbial interactions are essential for the stability and functionality of microbial communities   [48] . To explore this aspect within MABR and CABR biofilms, molecular ecological network (MEN) analysis at the genus level was performed ( Fig. S5 ).  The MABR biofilm treating ammonium-rich wastewater (500 mg NH 4  + -N/L; MABR-2) exhibited a simpler microbial network compared to the biofilm that treating low-strength ammonium wastewater (50 mg NH 4  + -N/L; MABR-1), characterized by fewer links (379   vs.   484), a lower average degree (avgK: 15.160   vs.   19.360), but higher geodesic distance (GD: 2.460   vs . 2.008) and harmonic distance (HD: 1.790   vs.   1.562) ( Table S5 ). Despite this simpler network, the MABR-2 biofilm demon -  strated higher modularity (0.491) compared to the MABR-1 biofilm (0.219) ( Table S5 ), suggesting a stronger tendency for microbial pop -  ulations to form distinct subunits (i.e., modules)   [49] . Moreover, the MABR-2 biofilm MEN exhibited a higher proportion of positive in -  teractions (approximately 54 %) compared to the MABR-1 biofilm MEN (approximately 48 %) ( Fig. S5 a, c), suggesting enhanced cell – cell in -  teractions   (e.g.,   co-aggregation)   or   indirect   facilitation   (e.g.,   co- metabolism   or   cross-feeding)   in   the   MABR-2   biofilm   [50] .   The increased modularity and positive interactions are likely vital for sus -  taining biofilm functionality, particularly under stressful conditions (i. e., FA and FNA stress).  A comparison of the MENs between MABR and CABR biofilms revealed that   Nitrosomonas   exhibited significantly greater connectivity in MABR biofilms, forming interactions with 29 neighboring genera in the MABR-1 biofilm and 14 genera in the MABR-2 biofilm ( Fig. S5 e, g). In contrast,   Nitrosomonas   had fewer interactions in CABR biofilms, connecting with just 8 genera in the CABR-1 biofilm and 6 genera in the CABR-2 biofilm ( Fig. S5 f, h). The more extensive interaction network in MABR biofilm is likely to facilitate improved resource exchange, meta -  bolic flexibility, and resilience   [51] , which in turn may contribute to the more robust nitrification and nitritation within the MABRs compared to CABRs ( Fig. 1 e).  4.   Discussion  This study investigated the nitritation performance of self-assembled nitrifying biofilms in MABRs, utilizing a combined strategy of zero-seed sludge start-up and low DO BL   control. The results showed that long-term efficient nitritation was achieved only when treating ammonium-rich wastewater   (500   mg   NH 4  + -N/L),   while   it   rapidly   achieved   but collapsed after day 20 in the mainstream wastewater systems (50 mg NH 4  + -N/L). This finding suggests that, even when the initial introduction of NOB is minimized and conditions unfavorable to NOB survival are provided   by   zero-seed   sludge   strategy,   continuous   stressing   NOB  Fig. 4.

proliferation remains a significant challenge under mainstream condi -  tions. Our results elucidated that the environmental filtering effects (i.e., selective pressures favoring the survival and growth of certain species while limiting others) induced by FA and FNA stress, which is inherent for ammonium-rich systems, play a critical role in shaping the microbial community   structure   and   ultimately   determining   robust   nitritation performance in MABR and CABR with a NAR of approximately 99.0 % ( Fig. 1 ).  It should also be noted that MABRs exhibited significantly enhanced ammonium removal performance compared to CABRs in both high- and low-strength ammonium scenarios, which can be attributed to the membrane aeration in MABRs that transforms the inert gas-permeable membrane   into   the   active   substratum   for   biofilm   formation.   This advantage highlights the practical potential of MABR technology to optimize nitrogen removal processes, even if it cannot achieve stable nitritation in the mainstream scenario, but instead facilitates efficient and energy-saving complete nitrification. Therefore, the MABR tech -  nology is particularly effective for optimizing the nitrification process in low-strength ammonium wastewater (e.g., municipal wastewater) and enhancing the nitritation process in high-strength ammonium waste -  water (e.g., landfill leachate), offering a promising solution for more sustainable   and   energy-efficient   nitrogen   removal   in   wastewater treatment.  4.1.   Instability of mainstream nitritation: Ineffectiveness of selective pressure from zero-seed sludge start-up and low DO BL   concentration  The zero-seed sludge start-up strategy could effectively promote the colonization of AOB on membrane surfaces and rapidly initiate nitrita -  tion. However, achieving long-term stable mainstream nitritation (50 mg NH 4  + -N/L) remains challenging, even when a controlled low DO BL  concentration ( <   0.4 mg/L) was applied using the membrane aeration pattern.  In the initiation of MABR-1 operation, in the absence of inoculum, AOB (originating from tap water) served as the pioneer species, adhering to the membrane surface and initiating mainstream nitritation ( Fig. 1 a). This ecological priority effect, where AOB outcompete NOB, was driven by favorable conditions, such as abundant ammonium availability and a favorable temperature (~30   ◦ C)   [39] , that favored AOB dominance. However, as nitrite accumulated in the system, conditions became also favorable for NOB enrichment, leading to a decline in the NAR from 94.7 % to 37.5 % between days 11 and 23 ( Fig. 1 a). This decline per -  sisted despite the low DO BL   levels (0.3   ±   0.1 mg/L) ( Fig. S3 a), sug -  gesting that the selective pressure exerted by low DO BL   was insufficient to suppress NOB growth. Consequently, the MABR-1 biofilm exhibited an enrichment of   Nitrospira   (a typical NOB), which reached a relative abundance of 1.88 % on day 90 ( Fig. 3 c).  Despite the observed deterioration in mainstream nitritation in both the MABR-1 and CABR-1, the overall NAR in MABR-1 was lower compared to CABR-1 ( Fig. 1 e), consistent with that of previous studies  [19,25] . This phenomenon may be attributed to the distinct mass transfer mechanisms between the counter-diffusional biofilm in MABRs and the co-diffusional biofilm in CABRs   [52] . In the MABR, oxygen is supplied from the lumen of the membrane fiber, diffusing through the membrane into the biofilm and subsequently into the bulk liquid, resulting in a higher DO concentration within the biofilm compared to the bulk liquid (0.3   ±   0.1 mg/L;   Fig. S3 a). Given that high DO con -  centrations have been reported to enhance nitritation by stimulating AOB activity   [22] , we initially hypothesized that the oxygen gra -  dient — characterized by high DO concentrations in the inner layer and low DO   concentrations in the outer layer — would facilitate nitrite accumulation. However, our findings, in conjunction with previous studies   [19,25] , revealed that this oxygen gradient did not provide the expected benefits. Instead, the counter-diffusional biofilm structure enhanced both AOB and NOB activity, as evident by significantly increased ARR and lower NAR in MABR-1 compared to CABR-1 ( p   <  0.001,   Fig. 1 e), likely due to the operation of the membrane aeration (discussed in   Section 4.3 ).  The instability of mainstream nitritation highlights the need for further exploration of more effective strategies to control NOB prolif -  eration within MABRs when treating low-strength wastewater. Future studies could focus on optimizing the zero-seed sludge strategy by integrating additional approaches, such as ultra-low DO BL   concentra -  tions   (e.g.,   <   0.1   mg/L),   operating   under   acidic   conditions   (pH: 5.0 – 5.2), and employing selective chemical inhibitors (e.g., sulfate), for more effectively suppressing NOB growth under mainstream conditions  [28,53,54] .  4.2.   Robust nitritation in ammonium-rich wastewater: Environmental filtering driven by FA and FNA  By implementing a zero-seed sludge start-up strategy in conjunction with   controlled   low   DO BL ,   sidestream   MABR-2   maintained   robust nitritation (NAR   ＞   98 %) during the whole operational period ( Fig. 1 ). The superior nitritation performance in MABR-2, compared to main -  stream MABR-1, was largely due to the additional selective pressure from FA (2.9 – 80.4 mg/L; days 1 – 20) and FNA (0.3 – 1.4 mg/L; days 21 – 120) ( Fig. S3 b). This selective pressure favored the growth of stress- tolerant microbes (especially   Nitrosomonas ) while suppressing more sensitive species (e.g.,   Nitrispira ) ( Fig. 2 – 4). The   “ survival of the fittest ”  mechanism facilitated the development of a simplified but highly effi -  cient nitrifying biofilm ecosystem, which ensured both stable and high- rate nitritation.  FA and FNA, both recognized for their broad antimicrobial proper -  ties, play a significant role in filtering nitrifying biofilm communities  [55 – 57] . Compared to the MABR-1 biofilm, the MABR-2 biofilm dis -  played lower biomass ( Fig. 2 b-f), reduced microbial diversity ( Fig. 3 a), diminished metabolic functional redundancy ( Fig. 4 b), and a more simplified microbial interaction network ( Fig. S5 ). Specifically, species unable to tolerate high FA and FNA concentrations, e.g.,   Nitrospira , nearly disappeared in the MABR-2 biofilm ( Fig. 3 c)   [58] . Conversely, stress-tolerant genera, including   Nitrosomonas   (AOB), alongside   unclas -  sified_f__Chitinophagaceae   and   unclassified_f__Xanthomonadaceae ,   flour -  ished in the MABR-2 biofilm ( Fig. 3 c), becoming key contributors to essential metabolic functions ( Fig. 4 b). The adaptability of   Nitrosomonas  is linked to molecular mechanisms, e.g., the upregulation of oxidative stress enzymes, DNA and protein repair enzymes, and energy production enzymes, which provide   Nitrosomonas   with a competitive advantage in resource acquisition (e.g., substrates and metabolites) under stressful conditions   [59] . Importantly, the selective enrichment of   Nitrosomonas  combined with the inhibition of   Nitrospira   played a key role in sustaining stable nitritation in MABR-2 (NAR   ＞   98 %;   Fig. 1 e). A similar pattern was observed in the CABR-2 biofilm when compared to the CABR-1 biofilm.  Despite experiencing destabilizing pressures, the MABR-2 biofilm ecosystem   exhibited   adaptive   responses.   The   increased   modularity promoted the development of specialized sub-communities, which effi -  ciently processed substrates and buffered against disruptions ( Fig. S5 a, c and   Table S5 )   [60] . Additionally, a higher proportion of positive mi -  crobial interactions supported the establishment of a cooperative mi -  crobial network ( Fig. S5 a, c), improving both the productivity and stability of the community under stressful conditions   [51,61] . These findings revealed the adaptive potential and functional optimization of the microbial community in response to environmental stressors, ulti -  mately maintaining ecosystem performance under adverse conditions.  4.3.   Enhanced nitritation and nitrification in MABRs: The role of active substratum in efficient nitrifying biofilm formation  Efficient nitrification and nitritation were established in MABRs when treating both low- and high-strength wastewater (50 and 500 mg NH 4  + -N/L), with ARRs of 1.5- and 1.9-fold higher than those observed in  J. Li et al.   Chemical   Engineering   Journal   507   (2025)   160519  8
CABRs, respectively ( p   <   0.001;   Fig. 1 e). The enhanced ammonium removal in MABRs was primarily attributed to the adopted aeration membrane   that   served   as   an   active   substratum   and   significantly improved oxygen transfer efficiency, reduced biofilm disruption caused by bubbles, and lower mass transfer resistance within biofilms. These properties facilitated biofilm development and promoted the growth of functional bacteria (e.g.,   Nitrosomonas ), contributing to superior nitri -  fication and nitritation performance.  In traditional aeration systems, such as diffused aeration, air bubbles rise rapidly to the surface of wastewater and over 70 % of the oxygen will escape into the atmosphere, leading to inefficient oxygen transfer and the loss of aeration energy   [62] . In contrast, MABRs employ bubbleless aeration, which directly delivers oxygen to the nitrifying biofilm through gas-permeable membranes, resulting in higher oxygen transfer rates (OTRs) compared to CABRs with diffused aeration   [63] . In this study, the membrane aeration in MABRs demonstrated higher standard OTRs (0.7 – 1.1 g O 2 /h) in clean water, as compared to diffused aeration (0.6 – 0.8 g O 2 /h) ( Fig. S6   and   Text S6 ). After the biofilm for -  mation on the membrane surface, MABRs can exhibit significantly higher apparent OTRs due to microbial activity (e.g., up to 6-fold)   [64] . The enhanced oxygen transfer capacity enables more molecular oxygen (i.e., the terminal electron acceptor) to participate in aerobic metabolic processes,   thereby   promoting   ammonium   oxidation   metabolism (catabolism) and ATP generation for cell division (anabolism), thus driving higher microbial growth and activity   [65,66] . Additionally, the bubbleless aeration in MABRs eliminates interference from bubbles with biofilm development, thereby creating a favorable microenvironment for microbial colonization on the substratum surface   [67] .  Consequently, MABR biofilms contained more biomass, higher EPS content, and a higher relative abundance of   Nitrosomonas   compared to CABR biofilms ( Fig. 2   and   Fig. 3 c), leading to enhanced nitritation and nitrification. Furthermore, the interactions between   Nitrosomonas   and other microbial genera were more intricate in MABR biofilms, especially in terms of positive associations ( Fig. S5 e-h). These positive associations, such as the exchange of information and materials, may facilitate more efficient metabolic functionality (e.g., ammonium oxidation) and over -  all systems performance   [51] .  Although MABRs developed thicker nitrifying biofilms ( Fig. 2 a-d), microbial viability was significantly higher, with live bacteria consti -  tuting 89 % and 91 % in MABR-1 and MABR-2 biofilms, respectively, compared to 73 % and 74 % in CABR-1 and CABR-2 biofilms ( Fig. 2 e-j). This disparity may be due to the counter-diffusion mechanism in MABR biofilms, which provide dual exchange surface area – the liquid-biofilm interface and the membrane-biofilm interface – while CABR biofilms provide just one liquid-biofilm interface. This dual-interface structure in MABRs reduces mass transfer resistance for critical substrates, thereby supporting higher microbial vitality within biofilms.  Collectively, the aeration regime in MABRs significantly enhanced oxygen supply efficiency, minimized bubble-induced biofilm disruption, and reduced mass transfer resistance within biofilms. These character -  istics   facilitated   biomass   growth,   improved   live/dead   ratios,   and increased   relative   abundances   of   functional   bacteria   (e.g.,   Nitro -  somonas ), contributing to the superior ammonium removal performance in MABRs compared to CABRs in both low- and high-strength ammo -  nium   wastewater   treatment.   Therefore,   MABR   technology   shows considerable promise in optimizing ammonium oxidation through both nitrification and nitritation processes, offering a pathway toward more sustainable and efficient wastewater management practices.  5.   Conclusions  This study investigated the nitritation performance of self-assembled nitrifying biofilms in MABRs, utilizing a combined strategy of zero-seed sludge   start-up   and   low   DO BL   concentration   control.   The   findings confirm the effectiveness of MABRs in treating ammonium-rich waste -  water and elucidate the challenges for stable mainstream nitritation. The pivotal role of the aeration membrane in facilitating biofilm for -  mation is also highlighted based on the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of the self-assembled biofilms. These results pave the way for   high-performance nitritation   by   introducing   membrane   aerated biofilm for achieving low-carbon wastewater treatment. The specific conclusions are as follows:  1) The zero-seed sludge start-up strategy could effectively promote the colonization of AOB on membrane surfaces and rapidly initiate nitritation. However, achieving long-term stable mainstream nitritation (50 mg NH 4  + -N/L) remains challenging, even when a controlled low DO BL   concentration ( <   0.4 mg/L) is applied using the membrane aera -  tion pattern.  2) Robust nitritation was attained when treating ammonium-rich wastewater (500 mg NH 4  + -N/L) in both MABRs and CABRs, with a NAR of approximately 99.0 %. The environmental filtering effect driven by FA and FNA resulted in the formation of a simplified yet highly efficient biofilm ecosystem, characterized by reduced biomass content, diminished   microbial   diversity,   simplified   microbial   network,   and decreased functional redundancy. This selective pressure particularly favored stress-tolerant microbes (especially   Nitrosomonas ), while out -  competing sensitive species (e.g.,   Nitrispira ), thereby ensuring stable and high-rate nitritation.  3) The aeration regime in MABRs significantly enhanced oxygen supply efficiency, minimized bubble-induced biofilm disruption, and reduced mass transfer resistance within biofilms. These characteristics facilitated biomass growth, improved live/dead ratios, and increased relative abundances of functional bacteria (e.g.,   Nitrosomonas ), collec -  tively contributing to the superior ammonium removal performance in MABRs compared to CABRs in both low- and high-strength ammonium wastewater treatment.

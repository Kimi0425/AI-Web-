Over the past decades, membrane   processes   have   revolutionized   municipal   water   treatment   with   membrane   bioreactors   (MBRs) becoming a widely accepted process for municipal and then industrial wastewater (IW) treatment. By the same token, MABR technologies were initially applied to municipal wastewater; however, their application in in -  dustrial settings is still emerging. Despite the promise of MABRs due to the biofilm ’ s tolerance to IW toxins, there is a lack of information on their industrial applications. Therefore, this paper critically reviews the feasibility and application of MABRs for IW treatment, including pharmaceutical, chemical, refinery, petrochemical, oilfield, landfill leachate and other complex industrial waters. Three existing technology vendors with full-scale expe -  rience were compared; however, additional providers with innovative designs may provide step-changes in performance. Key outcomes highlight the effectiveness of MABRs in reducing carbon, nitrogen, and xenobiotics from high-strength IWs at bench and pilot scales. Critical factors influencing MABR performance, such as biofilm thickness (BT) were correlated to organics and nitrogen removal efficiency in industrial applications. Review of advances in MABR modeling techniques showed that current models lack the needed resolution for large and dynamic industrial systems. Additionally, the review compares municipal and industrial applications of MABRs, emphasizing the unique challenges and innovations required for their adoption in IW treatment. Overall, the MABR process was found to be feasible for industrial applications with pilot and/or demonstration-scale testing being necessary to further optimize process performance.  1.   Introduction  Industrial freshwater use in the US, spanning food, mining, paper, steel,   chemical,   and   petroleum   refining   industries,   is   estimated   at 14,800 million gallons per day ( Dieter et al., 2018 ). Wastewater from these   processes   may   contain   carcinogenic   and   harmful   pollutants ( Jafarinejad and Jiang, 2019 ;   Yasasve et al., 2022 ). Stricter environ -  mental regulations, along with circular economy and climate change concerns, necessitate innovative extensive water treatment solutions while remaining intensive in application ( Ramanathan and Feng, 2009 ;  Gherghel et al . , 2019 ;   Smol et al .,   2020 ;   Dutta   et al.,   2021 ;   Al-Maas et al . , 2022 ;   Fox, 2022 ;   T  ́ oth et al . , 2022 ). Biological treatment, a cost-effective technology, is widely used in industrial facilities for biological oxidation of dissolved chemicals, typically through CAS systems ( Jafarinejad and Jiang, 2019 ;   Olajire, 2020 ). CAS configuration include an aeration basin with   suspended   bacteria   (activated   sludge)   and   a   gravity   clarifier ( Metcalf and Eddy, 2003 ). While effective in removing toxic pollutants, these systems are energy-intensive and may release nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and other greenhouse gases due to excessive mixing and limited oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) (~10%) ( Conthe et al., 2019 ;   Duan et al., 2021 ;  He et al., 2021 ). Additionally, industrial CAS units are not designed for nitrogen removal, and upgrades to denitrifying configurations are costly ( Faber, 2019 ;   Ishak et al., 2012 ). Membrane aerated biofilm reactors (MABRs) afford a significant step-change over CAS. The key advantages of MABRs include ( C ˆ ot  ́ e et al., 2015 ;   He et al., 2021 ;   Houweling et al., 2017 ;   Kinh et al., 2017a ;   Lu et al., 2021 ;   Syron and Casey, 2012 ;  Uri-Carre  ̃ no et al., 2024 ;   Veleva et al., 2022 ):  *   Corresponding author at: Center for Advanced Materials, Qatar University, PO Box 2713, Doha, Qatar.

•   Energy efficiency : higher OTEs up to 80% reduce energy costs;  •   Lower emissions : bubbleless systems reduce the release of air pol -  lutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs);  •   Simultaneous processes : enable nitrification, denitrification, and carbon removal in one bioreactor;  •   Compactness : requires a smaller footprint compared to conven -  tional biological systems; and  •   Retrofit capabilities : can be quickly integrated into existing CAS systems for bioprocess intensification  MABRs use gas-permeable hollow fiber (HF) or spiral wound mem -  branes to grow biofilm and supply air and O 2 . Oxygen diffuses from the lumen or air contact side, while the substrate is supplied from the shell or water contact side, creating a counter-diffusional process ( Nerenberg, 2016 ). This setup allows for efficient removal of dissolved carbon and ammonia, maintaining a bubbleless, anoxic environment conducive to nitrogen removal. Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) occurs as nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia to nitrite (NO 2 -   ) and ni -  trate (NO 3 -   ), and denitrifying bacteria convert these nitrogen oxides to nitrogen gas (N 2 ) ( Metcalf and Eddy, 2003 ). Stratification in microbial community structure, with aerobic autotrophs and heterotrophs near the membrane and anoxic heterotrophs on the outer layer ( Fig 1 ), en -  hances functional stability against shock loads and inhibitory chemicals typical of industrial wastewaters (IWs) ( Martin and Nerenberg, 2012 ;  Nerenberg, 2016 ;   Rittmann et al., 2004 ;   Syron and Casey, 2008a ;  Waheed et al., 2013 ;   Wobus and R  ̈ oske, 2000 ;   Zhou et al., 2020 ). Over the past decades, membrane processes like ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO) have revolutionized municipal water treatment ( Jalab et al., 2019 ), and led to UF-based membrane bioreactors (MBR) for municipal wastewater treatment compliance and recycling projects ( Adham et al., 2018 ;   Hirani et al., 2010 ). Similarly, MABRs technologies have been initially applied to municipal wastewater ( Corsino and Tor -  regrossa, 2022 ;   Guglielmi et al., 2020 ;   Heffernan, 2024 ;   Heffernan et al., 2017 ;   Kunetz et al., 2016 ;   Peeters and McMains, 2023 ;   Uri-Carre  ̃ no et al., 2021 ). However, industrial MABR applications are still emerging, despite showing significant promise due to the biofilm ’ s tolerance to industrial toxins, salinity, and reduced formation of GHGs, including N 2 O ( He et al., 2021 ;   Kinh et al., 2017b ;   Uri-Carre  ̃ no et al., 2024 ). Currently, there is a gap in literature reviews on MABR IW applications, potentially hindering innovation and knowledge transfer from munic -  ipal to industrial settings. This paper aims to address this gap by examining:  •   Current configurations and advancements in MABR technology for a wide range of IW applications;  •   Key factors affecting MABR performance;  •   Impact of BT on process performance;  •   Advances in MABR process modeling;  •   Comparison of municipal and industrial MABR applications; and finally  •   MABR challenges, innovations, and emission considerations.  2.   MABR configurations  Three major commercial players in MABRs technologies include Veolia (Water Technologies   &   Solutions) ZeeLung ™ , OxyMem ™   (a Dupont brand) OxyFILM and OxyFAS, and Fluence Subre and Aspiral ™ .  ZeeLung ™   and OxyMem ™   use HF dense membrane materials like pol -  ydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), while Fluence employs spiral wound gas- permeable membranes to support the biofilm-based treatment ( Fig. 2 ). These configurations are typically used as pure MABR systems for greenfield applications or as Hybrid MABR/CAS or IFAS systems for process intensification.  Table   1   presents   a   comparison   of   key   parameters   of   various commercially available MABRs. Zeelung ™ , OxyMem ™ , and Fluence all exhibit a high technology readiness level (TRL), aeration efficiency, low sludge production, and very good ( > 60 – 90%) municipal wastewater carbon and nitrogen removal performance. These HF membranes pro -  vide a significantly larger membrane surface area for biofilm growth compared to Fluence ’ s spiral wound membranes, thus limiting Fluence ’ s application to small and medium-sized decentralized treatment plants ( Tirosh and Shechter, 2018 ). A distinguishing aspect of MABR perfor -  mance is the control of BT to prevent membrane fouling and clogging. Zeelung ™   controls BT by using exhaust air from the system, which is sent to a sensor that measures O 2   concentration. Additionally, based on O 2   results and proprietary models, scouring and substrate mixing are conducted at timed intervals using a coarse bubble aeration grid ( C ˆ ot  ́ e et al., 2015 ;   Guglielmi et al., 2020 ). OxyMem ™   employs a patented online automated BT measurement and scouring system based on an argon pressure decay diffusion curve, which correlates a biofilm thick -  ness index (BTI) to biomass weight. The scouring system uses dedicated blowers to produce coarse bubbles, and an Airlift system utilizes process off-gas to enhance mixing and evenly distribute substrate and nutrients among the fibers ( Heffernan, 2024 ;   Heffernan et al., 2017 ). Fluence MABR manages BT by circulating mixed liquor through the water spacers that separate the spiral wound membrane module. Each MABR reactor is equipped with coarse bubble diffusers for periodic mixing. The air mixing typically operates 2.5%-5% of the time ( Tirosh, 2018 ;   Tirosh and Shechter, 2018 ).  3.   MABR applications to IW treatment  MABRs like ZeeLung ™   and OxyMem ™   have been evaluated at pilot and   bench   scale   for   the   biological   removal   of   high-strength   IWs including pharmaceutical, chemical, refinery, petrochemical, oilfield, landfill   leachate,   steel   pickling,   coal   chemical   RO   concentrate,  Fig 1.   Membrane aerated biofilm concentration profile (adapted from   Syron (2015) ). Oxygen diffuses from the membrane outward, selecting for the various biofilm layers ( Syron and Casey, 2008a ).  G.

aquaculture, and livestock wastewaters. A summary of MABR perfor -  mance with various membrane configurations and type, influent char -  acteristics, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and carbon and nitrogen removal efficiencies (REs) are presented in   Table 2 .  3.1.   Pharmaceutical and chemical wastewater  Several bench and pilot scale studies have demonstrated the feasi -  bility of treating dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen compounds, and pharmaceutical and chemical waste using MABRs. These studies eval -  uated various configurations of MABR system including 1-stage and 2- stage Zeelung TM   with dense HF membranes, PDMS and PVDF as pure MABR or as a pre-treatment before activated carbon or post-activated carbon   and/or   pre-treatment   to   ceramsite   a   microporous   ceramic- based filter ( Huang et al., 2023 ) ( Table 2 ). The influent wastewaters were medium- to high strength with COD ranging from 300 to 3500 mg/L, NH 4  +   from ~5 to 2500 mg/L, and TN from ~9 to 300 mg/L. The COD, NH 4  +   and TN removals were up to 90 – 99% RE for all parameters. The HRTs varied widely from 8 – 50 hrs., with an average of ~25 hrs. which is in the range of an extended aeration systems employed in in -  dustrial CAS plants (HRT   =   18 – 24 h) and municipal denitrifying facil -  ities (HRT   =   5 – 30 h) ( Metcalf and Eddy, 2003 ). While IW generated by pharmaceutical operations may be mixed with municipal wastewater and not prevalent in industrial applications, it contains xenobiotics and organic micropollutants that are highly detrimental to the environment and human health ( Singh et al., 2023 ).   Fig. 3   shows the reported MABR REs of 24 pharmaceutical and chemical byproducts in IWs under specific conditions. The results indicated MABR capacity to remove 95 – 99.9% of acetaminophen, bisphenol-A, estrone (E1), ibuprofen, and triclosan which are nonpolar, hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic pollutants, respectively.   However,   lower   REs   (22 – 69%)   were   observed   for gemfibrozil,   ketoprofen,   mefenamic   acid   and   naproxen   which   are negatively charged and acidic substances. Lower REs were obtained for carbamazepine, diclofenac, primidone, gemfibrozil, and ketoprofen due to low biotransformation rates ( Sanchez-Huerta et al., 2023 ,   2022 ). Phenolics, acetone, toluene and some fluorinated compounds were also readily removed above 90% ( Heffernan et al . , 2009 ;   Misiak et al . , 2011 ;  Mei et al., 2019b ;   Tian et al . , 2019 ,   2020 ;   Wu et al . , 2024 ).  3.2.   Petroleum refinery and petrochemical wastewater  Typical   wastewater   from   petroleum   refinery   and   petrochemical processes contains a complex mix of pollutants, including hydrocarbons, sulfides, and heavy metals, which can impact bacterial activity in treatment systems ( IPIECA, 2010 ;   Jafarinejad and Jiang, 2019 ). The variability in molecular weight of these compounds, from low MW or -  ganics like acetate ( ≤ 59 g/mol) to particulate matter like asphaltenes ( > 40,000 g/mol), presents challenges for evaluating MABR perfor -  mance due to the presence of particulate and non-diffusible substrates ( National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2025 ;   Barrera et al., 2013 ).  3.2.1.   Petroleum refinery  A bench scale study investigated the degradation of petroleum re -  finery wastewater using an OxyMem ™   MABR unit with PDMS HF membranes ( Dicataldo, 2015 ). The unit operated for 169 days ( Fig. 4 ) and reached a steady state at ~120 days, showing a consistent COD RE until the end of the experiment. Despite fluctuations in COD load and potential toxicity, the MABR system generally achieved on average a COD RE of 80% ( Fig. 5 ). The TOC REs were also consistent with the COD during the same period, with an overall TOC RE reaching up to ~96% due to the removal of biodegradable organics. The NH 4  +   RE showed significant variability between day 27 – 120, with a downward trend from ~90% (day 29) to ~8% (day 71). The loss of nitrification was likely due to an inhibitory environment caused by occasional pH spikes and a significant increase in NH 4  +   load, which was not matched by the popu -  lation density, metabolic capacity, and resilience of nitrifying bacteria to toxic organics. This behavior corroborates findings by   Veleva et al .  (2022)   where shock loads of ammonia and toxic organics significantly inhibited nitrification. From day 71 to 120, the system showed an up -  ward trend in NH 4  +   RE, indicating acclimation, recovery, and stabiliza -  tion of nitrifiers. After day 120, the system reached a steady state with NH 4  +   RE up to 91%, reflecting a well-established nitrifying bacterial population. The MABR reached maximum TN RE of   > 90% corre -  sponding to a TN in the effluent of the MABR unit (TNout) of 4 mg/L at day 164.  3.2.2.   Petrochemical  Veleva et al. (2022)   employed two OxyMem ™   MABRs pilot units in series,   with   a   volume of   ~54   L   and   HRT of   10   h each to   treat  Fig. 2.

petrochemical condensate. After start-up, the process was operated in continuous pilot operation on synthetic feed and transitioned to actual petrochemical feed. At steady state operation ( >   100 d), the pilot ach -  ieved an overall RE of TOC, BOD 5 , organic acids (acetate, propionate, and formate), phenol, and ammonia of 85%, 95%, 98%, 98%, and   >  90%, respectively. The system was able to perform SND without traces of intermediate by-products, NO 2 -   and NO 3 -   . Higher OTE were observed of   >   21%, compared to the CAS processes (~10%) ( He et al., 2021 ).  3.3.   Oilfield wastewater  Oilfield wastewater, typically known as produced water, is hard to biotreat due to high concentrations of organic and inorganic constitu -  ents and the presence of toxic compounds. The produced water typically contains various concentrations of TOC mainly hydrocarbons and field chemicals (500 - 2000 mg/L), total dissolved solids (2510 - 247,000 mg/ L), chlorides (62 - 152,750 mg/L) and pH (4.3   –   8.8) ( Adham et al., 2018 ).   Li et al .   (2015)   employed a bench scale MABR coupled with  Fig. 4.   OxyMem ™   MABR bench scale unit.  Fig. 5.

ozone and biological activated carbon (hybrid MABR) to treat oilfield wastewater. The inoculum for the biofilm was composed by ADB350M engineering bacteria (Advance Biotechnologies of Canada) specifically formulated for high adaptability to petroleum pollutants. The influent characteristics and REs are presented in   Table 2 . A long-term study conducted for 60 days at 0.06 m/s feed flow rate and HRT of 12 – 14 h shows a good COD, oil, NH 4  + -N, and TN REs of 82.3%, 85.7%, 32.1%, and 71.9%, respectively. The study also examined dissolved oxygen concentrations gradients at different BTs under varying aeration pres -  sures. At moderate lumen pressure, the biofilm exhibited better strati -  fication of the community structure, with both anaerobic and aerobic layers suitable for microbes with different functions.  3.4.   Landfill leachate wastewater  Landfill leachate is a type of industrial waste very high in ammonia which is harmful to fish and wildlife needing treatment before its release to the environment ( Syron and Casey, 2012 ).   Syron, et al .   (2015)   re -  ported MABR ammonium RE of 80 – 99% with influent concentrations of 500 – 2500 mg/L, HRT of over 4 days as compared to 40 days for sequencing batch reactors. The ammonium loading rate reached up to 3.2   g   NH 4  + -N   m -2   d -1   with   pure   oxygen   and   observed   data   and multi-species AQUASIM model showed that the MABR performance was not limited by the O 2   delivery but by NH 4  +   transport to the biofilm attached to the HF membranes. The OTE was as high as 80% and the standard aeration efficiencies were up to 10 kg O 2   kWh -1   which are much higher than typical CAS (1 – 1.5 O 2   kWh -1 ) ( Table 3 ).  3.5.   Steel pickling   &   coal chemical RO concentrate wastewater  Steel pickling wastewater is generated during the steel processing and manufacturing. Strong acid solutions (sulfuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acid) are used to rinse the steel to eliminate rust from its surfaces. This process generates wastewater containing high concentrations of refractory   organics,   nitrogen   and   dissolved   solids.   Conventional physico-chemical   technologies   like   ion   exchange,   coagulation- flocculation, adsorption and catalytic reduction have been employed to treat these types of wastewaters, however they are costly and generate toxic byproducts ( Sun et al., 2022 ). A two-stage MABR system was evaluated to treat steel pickling rinse wastewater. The best REs for COD, NH 4  + -N and TN were 62.8%, 99.6% and 51.7%, respectively. Aeration pressure was found to be more important than salinity in the control of shortcut nitrification. Moreover, the biofilm secreted ten times more extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) as aeration pressure and two times as much as salinity increased. Coal chemical RO concentrate wastewater is high in salinity, and refractory organics posing an envi -  ronmental hazard if not properly treated. Advanced oxidation, adsorp -  tion, electro-oxidation and membrane distillation have been employed to treat these types of wastewaters; however, they are expensive and generate harmful bioproducts ( Lan et al., 2018 ;   Liu et al., 2020 ). A three-stage bench scale MABR achieved REs of COD, NH 4  + -N and TN of 81%, 92% and 71%, respectively ( Table 2 ). SND as well as shortcut nitrogen removal were also achieved and a salinity of 3% did not caused a significant decrease in treatment efficiency and microbial diversity ( Lan et al., 2018 ). A similar study employing a three-stage bench scale MABR on coal chemical RO concentrate with lower salinity (0.67%) showed REs for COD, NH 4  + – N, NO 3 – N, and TN of 69%, 81%, 55%, and 54%, respectively ( Liu et al., 2020 ).  3.6.   Aquaculture and livestock wastewater  MABR technology was applied to IW laden with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) a commonly used antibiotic medication in aquaculture. The study showed that the MABR removed 77.2 ± 2.6% of SMX ( Xia et al . , 2024 ). Livestock wastewater generated via anaerobic fermentation of cow manure containing pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter was treated using MABR. The REs of NH 4  + -N and COD were up to 90%   and   85%,   respectively,   at   optimal   conditions.   The   authors concluded that because the inner biofilm had higher amounts of EPS compared to the outer biofilm, it reduced the toxicity impact of high cow manure waste concentrations on the aerobic bacteria (especially nitri -  fying bacteria) population located near the membrane surface ( Gong et al., 2020 ).  4.   Key factors in MABR performance  The MABR performance is significantly influenced by several key factors, including oxygen transfer rate (OTR) and OTE, the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), biofilm development and microbial diversity, BT, and counter-diffusion mechanisms.  4.1.   OTR and OTE  OTR and OTE are key performance indicators used to evaluate aeration capacity of MABRs ( Corsino and Torregrossa, 2022 ;   C ˆ ot  ́ e et al., 2015 ;   Guglielmi et al., 2020 ;   He et al., 2021 ). The OTR (gO 2   d -1 ) and OTE (%) are typically calculated by off-gas analysis of molar fractions of O 2   in the exhaust gas (O 2ex   (%)), O 2   in the inlet air (Q 2in (%)), and air flow rate (Q in   &   Q out   in Nm 3   m -2   h -1 ) in flow-through MABR systems as shown in   eq. (2) - (4)   ( C ˆ ot  ́ e et al., 2015 ):  OTR   =   J O 2   .   A m   (2)  J O 2   =   24   M O  V M  ( Q in   .   O 2 in       Q out   .   O 2 ex   )   (3)  OTE   =   J O 2  24   .

A summary of aeration parameters for various industrial MABR applications is presented in  Table 3 . MABR aeration modes can be either flow-through or dead-end based on lumen gas flow. In the flow through mode, where the distal end  Table 3  Key aeration parameters in industrial MABR applications.

of the membrane is opened, gas (i.e., air or pure O 2 ) is passed through the membrane lumen directly to the biofilm and the exhaust gas (O 2  and/or CO 2 ) is monitored for treatment performance ( Guglielmi et al., 2020 ;   Veleva et al., 2022 ;   Wei et al., 2012 ). In contrast, the dead-end mode, where the distal end is closed, delivers all supplied oxygen to the biofilm, achieving up to 100% OTE and reducing aeration energy ( Tian et al., 2020 ). However, the dead-end system suffers from lower OTRs due to back-diffusion of gases including CO 2   and O 2 . This causes a significant drop in O 2   partial pressure in the membrane lumen and consequent   reduction   in   biological   treatment   capacity.   The flow-through mode is preferred for commercial use due to its ability to achieve higher OTRs with respect to the dead-end systems, leading to better contaminant removal and treatment capacity ( Casey et al., 2008 ;  Guglielmi et al., 2020 ;   Kunetz et al., 2016 ;   Peeters and McMains, 2023 ). Selecting aeration modes involves balancing OTR vs. OTE and treatment capacity vs. aeration energy. Innovative strategies, such as alternating between flow-through and dead-end modes, can improve both OTE and OTR ( Perez-Calleja et al., 2017 ). OTEs reported for industrial MABRs applications range from 21 – 75%, which is significantly higher than CAS fine bubble aeration systems. MABRs for industrial applications show superior aeration efficiencies (4 – 11 KgO 2   kWh -1 ) compared to CAS systems (1.0 – 1.5 KgO 2   kWh -1 ) ( Table 3 ). These advantages make MABR systems   more   suitable   for   industrial   applications   requiring high-performance aeration, such as petrochemical, refinery, landfill leachate, and others. Given that aeration is a major energy cost in wastewater treatment plants (45 – 75%) ( Rosso et al., 2008 ), MABRs ’  high efficiency can lead to significant energy savings ( Casey et al., 2008 ). Using pure oxygen in MABRs enhances OTRs and its penetration into the biofilm, enabling high COD and ammonia REs ( Brindle and Stephenson, 1996 ;   Syron et al . , 2015 ;   Abdelfattah et al . , 2024 ). This can reduce membrane area requirements and in turn capital investment ( Syron et al . , 2015 ). However, an enriched oxygen environment can lead to   thicker   aerobic   biofilm,   suppression   of   denitrification   genes, increased mass transfer resistance, and the need for more vigorous biofilm scouring to maintain optimal MABR performance ( Cole et al . , 2004 ;   Stricker et al . , 2011 ;   Syron et al .,   2015 ). In addition, pure oxygen safety management constraints may hinder its use ( Air Products and Chemicals, 2014 ).  4.2.   C/N ratio  The C/N ratio is critical in the formation of both nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial populations within the MABR biofilm ( Liu et al., 2010 ). Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification can be achieved in the stratified biofilm when proper conditions exist, such as adequate oxygen penetration and C/N ratio.   Chang et al . (2022)   reported optimal C/N as a COD/N ratio of 4.3 for maximum TN RE (78.9%).   Liu et al . , (2010)   found that a COD/N ratio of 5 was optimal for nitrification and denitrification (93%, and 92%, respectively), with   Nitrosospira   and  Nitrospira   as the dominant nitrifiers. For a MABR system treating re -  finery wastewater the optimal COD/N ratio was found to be optimal between 7 and 13, with NH 4  +   and TN RE up to 96% and 91%, respec -  tively, at steady state conditions ( Dicataldo, 2015 ). Other studies have shown C/N ratios varying widely between 2 and 18, with stable SND results ( Li and Zhang, 2018 ;   Lin et al., 2016 ;   Meng et al., 2008 ;   Veleva et al., 2022 ).   Lin et al .   (2016)   suggested that maintaining a filtered COD/N ratio above 5 is optimal for achieving NH 4  +   and TN RE above 80%. Using filtered or soluble COD (sCOD) can be limiting, especially in IWs with particulate COD from heavy compounds like asphaltenes found in crude oil laden wastewater ( Barrera et al., 2013 ). However, in gen -  eral, an adequate COD/N ratio coupled with sufficient oxygen flux, highly influence the microbial community structure in the MABR bio -  film, particularly ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and denitrifying bacteria, and in turn, nitrogen removal ( Chang et al., 2022 ).  4.3.   Biofilm development and microbial diversity  Biofilm development and microbial diversity are the foundation for the biological transformations occurring within the MABR system ( He et al., 2021 ). Biofilm inoculums are usually sourced from local CAS, Anaerobic-Anoxic-Aerobic (A 2 O) systems, or fit-for-purpose engineered or mixed bacterial cultures that are either well-adapted and/or have been exposed to the targeted wastewater streams (e.g., petrochemical, pharmaceutical, chemical etc.) ( Mei et al., 2019a ;   Syron et al., 2015 ;  Van Ginkel et al., 2008 ;   Veleva et al., 2022 ;   Wei et al., 2012 ). Typically, the startup procedures include 1 – 25 days inoculation in batch mode, where the activated sludge (AS) is recirculated and continuously mixed in the MABR system with various volumes of synthetic or real waste -  water feeds ( Dicataldo, 2015 ;   Sanchez-Huerta et al., 2022 ;   Syron et al., 2015 ;   Tian et al., 2019 ;   Veleva et al., 2022 ). For pure MABR systems, the bulk biomass is removed, leaving only sessile bacteria to establish a biofilm structure on the membranes. These types of bacteria are a mix of aerobic AOBs, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOBs), anoxic denitrifiers and higher   life   forms   (protozoa   and   metazoa).   The   timing   for   biofilm establishment, including attachment and growth to reach adequate microbial density and steady-state performance, is critical in imple -  menting MABR technologies. Various reports indicate that bench and pilot-scale high-strength IW MABR applications reached steady-state conditions (i.e., stable COD, NH 4  + , and TN RE) after 60   –   120 days of operation ( Dicataldo, 2015 ;   Li et al., 2015 ;   Veleva et al., 2022 ). A summary of the microbial communities and techniques used to identify and quantify composition and structure of biofilm in MABRs treating IWs is presented in   Table 4 . Genomic analyses were carried out using high throughput sequencing, 16 rDNA/16s rRNA gene sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The most prevalent genus in MABR biofilms was shown to be the   pseudomonas , which is responsible for denitrification and carbon removal. Meanwhile,   nitrospira, nitro -  bacter   and   nitrosomonas   genera were reported to be the most abundant nitrifiers. In general, betaproteobacteria were found to be common among MABR biofilms.  4.4.   Biofilm thickness  The thickness of a biofilm is a key characteristic in biofilm processes including MABRs. It has been observed that the rate of substrate diffu -  sion, nitrification and denitrification, COD and TOC removal, as well as microbial   ecology   and   interactions,   are   largely   influenced   by   the thickness of the biofilm ( Martin and Nerenberg, 2012 ;   Torresi et al., 2016 ).   Casey et al. (2000)   discovered that the BT and intra-membrane oxygen pressure were the most important parameters affecting the MABR performance experimentally and via mathematical modelling. A thinner biofilm was shown to facilitate high substrate diffusion; how -  ever, MABR performance was hindered due to a lower concentration of biomass. On the other hand, a thicker biofilm increased pollutants removal but may lead to lower substrate diffusion ( Casey et al . , 1999 ,  2000 ;   Martin   and   Nerenberg,   2012 ;   Li   and   Zhang,   2018 ).   San -  chez-Huerta et al .   (2022)   showed that an increase in BT and cell density from 0.10 mm to 1.02 mm and from 3.1   ×   10 4   cells mL -1   to 2.2   ×   10 6  cells mL -1 , respectively, enhanced the MABR performance. These results were confirmed by   Sanchez-Huerta et al .   (2023)   in terms of NH 4  +  removal. However, there is an optimal BT where oxygen and substrates (NH 4  +   and COD) counter-diffusion and transport becomes limiting and an inactive layer of biofilm forms ( Casey et al., 2000 ).  4.4.1.   Correlation between BT, COD and NH 4  +   removal efficiencies  A comprehensive survey of available data on BT and MABR IW treatment performance was performed. Data trends revealed a good correlation between BT and COD RE (%) and NH 4  +   RE (%) (R 2   =   0.65 and 0.73) ( Fig. 6 ). Also, COD and NH 4  +   RE showed a strong relationship between these two variables (R 2   =   0.86) ( Fig. 6 ). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a p   <   0.05 indicating that there is a statistically  G. Dicataldo et al.   Water   Research   280   (2025)   123523  7
significant difference between BT, COD and NH 4  +   REs. The highest COD RE of 98.6% was observed at a BT of 1.6 mm, while NH 4  +   RE reached a maximum of 95% at a BT of 0.87 mm. No improvement was evident in NH 4  +   RE for a thickness of 1.02 mm. Calibrated model simulations of MABR performance vs. BT applied in municipal wastewater application showed that for optimal SND a minimum BT of 0.6 mm is recommended.  Elsayed et al. (2021)   showed that COD RE   > 89% at BT of 0.8 mm and nitrogen RE ( >   70%) was attained for BT of 0.6 to 1.2 mm ( Matsumoto et al., 2007 ). Although biofilm thickness is challenging to measure due to its variable nature, it appears that optimal NH 4  +   and COD REs in IWs favor slightly higher BTs compared to municipal systems, likely due to the complexity of IWs.  4.5.   Biofilm counter-diffusion mechanisms  Counter-diffusion of wastewater substrates and oxygen across the MABR biofilm is key in achieving optimal treatment. Studies have shown that the diffusion of organic substrate (e.g., xenobiotics), nutri -  ents and other contaminants from the bulk liquid into the biofilm de -  pends on several factors including molecular weight (MW), net charge of substrate in solution, heterogeneity of the biofilm (EPS, cell density and thickness), and sorption ( Debus and Wanner, 1992 ;   Horn and Morgen -  roth, 2006 ;   Stewart, 1996 ). Also, seminal research work by   Wanner et al. (1994)   show   the   importance   of   unique   stratification   of   specialist degrading microorganisms within the biofilm. Solutes with higher MWs and net negative charges showed lower diffusion due to matrix resis -  tance and repulsion from negatively charged microorganisms. Positively charged compounds penetrated faster due to electrostatic interactions. No significant impact was observed to the diffusion coefficients for pH values varying between 4 and 9, and ionic strength between 0.1 to 100 mM. Furthermore, heterogeneity of the biofilm was linked to variations of ~1 of order of magnitude in diffusion coefficients ( Zhang et al., 2011 ). In addition, microorganisms positioned deeper in the biofilm are subjected to lower substrate concentrations than those at the surface ( Fig. 7 ). As a result, these deeper organisms either convert substrates slowly   or   remain   inactive.   Conversely,   diffusion   gradients   lead   to varying redox zones throughout the biofilm, allowing multiple biolog -  ical reactions to occur within a single reactor (e.g., nitrification, deni -  trification, etc.). Overall, metabolic conversion rates could be managed by controlling the diffusion of soluble substrates like oxygen, NO 3 -   , NH 4  + , and carbon sources ( van den Berg, et al .   2021 ).. Although diffusion in different biofilms has been studied ( Stewart, 1998 ), there is still lack of  Table 4  Summary of relevant microbial communities in industrial MABR applications.

knowledge on the impact of MWs of sCOD on MABR biofilm RE. Most studies have focused on small substrates like acetate and glucose with MWs   <   350 g/mol ( Stewart, 2003 ). Few studies have measured diffusion coefficients for higher MW compounds and particles ( Peulen and Wil -  kinson, 2011 ;   Takenaka et al., 2009 ;   Zhang et al., 2011 ). Most IWs, particularly in oil and gas applications, contain high MWs compounds as  Fig. 7.   Biofilm counter-diffusion mechanisms.

compared   to   municipal   wastewaters.   Recent   studies   indicate   that diffusion of a model substrate (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) with MW of 10,000 g/mol (10 kDa) is hindered by the presence of a biofilm in activated granular sludge ( van den Berg et al., 2022 ). Therefore, diffu -  sion of sCOD of high MWs represents an emerging area of study for MABR given the difference between industrial and municipal waste -  water quality.  4.6.   Advances in MABR modeling  Biofilm modeling has evolved to address the challenges of treating industrial wastewater, characterized by variable organic loads, toxic compounds, and high nutrient concentrations ( Table 5 ). Conventional models,   like   those   described   by   Wanner   et   al.   (2006) ,   focus   on co-current oxygen diffusion and are less suited for the complexities of IW or advanced systems like MABRs. MABR-specific models, such as those by   Syron and Casey (2008b) , incorporate counter-diffusional oxygen transfer, improving predictions for systems with high oxygen demand or limited aeration capacity. Pressure-based and exhaust oxygen-based models ( Guglielmi et al., 2020 ;   Houweling and Daigger, 2019 ) opti -  mize oxygen transfer rates, which are critical for industries with high COD, though they struggle with high solids content and fluctuating substrate loads, making them more scalable for large-scale industrial applications.   Meanwhile,   advanced   models   like   2D   and   dynamic frameworks (e.g.,   Carlson et al., 2021 ;   Martin et al., 2013 ;   Schraa et al., 2018 ) enable complex interactions between oxygen, nitrogen species, and   organic   carbon,   essential   for   industrial   applications   involving nutrient removal. These models also provide deeper insights into spatial heterogeneity and temporal changes in biofilms, making them more suitable for fluctuating industrial wastewater. However, their applica -  tion is limited by higher computational demands and difficulties in capturing rapid responses to toxic shocks, which are common in in -  dustrial discharges. Simpler models, like 1D frameworks, remain more practical for laboratory-scale studies but arguably do not consider the full-range of variables with scale-up to dynamic industrial systems. Existing frameworks fall short in representing biofilm detachment and regrowth dynamics, which are crucial for maintaining long-term MABR performance under the high variability of industrial systems. Future efforts must address these limitations by calibrating models with online measurement of biofilm dynamics such as stochastic events such as biomass detachment and incorporating dynamic feedback mechanisms for real-time optimization. These advancements will ensure biofilm models are robust, accurate, and practical for the complexities of in -  dustrial wastewater treatment.  5.   Comparison of MABR treatment in industrial and municipal applications  In general, IWs are laden with xenobiotics, oil, metals, and other pollutants   not   typically   found   in   municipal   wastewater.   Hydraulic retention times and sludge retention times for nitrification and denitri -  fication in IW treatment systems are often much higher than those in municipal plants. This is due to the lower biodegradability of contami -  nants commonly found in petroleum refineries, petrochemical, phar -  maceutical, chemical, and other difficult to treat IWs ( Choi et al., 2017 ). As illustrated in   Fig. 6 , BT is directly correlated to COD/NH 4  +   RE, and a thicker biofilm is essential for removing xenobiotics from industrial wastewater. Consequently, the OTE and OTR are potentially impacted by the higher levels of organics and ammonium present in IWs ( Syron et al., 2015 ). This, in turn, may result in higher lumen air pressure, increased air flows, and greater energy consumption compared to municipal applications ( Syron and Casey, 2008a ). Additionally, even though dense membrane materials like PDMS are more suitable to IWs than microporous materials ( He et al., 2021 ) they can be affected by esters, ketones, acetone, chlorinated and aromatic solvents, and high chloride levels ( OxyMem, 2024 ), which are more prevalent in IW than in municipal streams. As a result, MABRs are more widely applicable in municipal plants. The use of MABRs for treating oily petrochemical and petroleum wastewaters may be limited due to the potential impact of oils and organics on biofilm and membrane fouling ( Wang et al., 2022 ). Future research direction should focus on creating new MABR mem -  brane materials, such as those resistant to organic solvents used in other process industries ( Ren et al., 2021 ). However, proper pre-treatment of free and emulsified oils using gravity separators or enhanced gravity separators (like dissolved gas flotation and hydrocyclones) is common practice in upstream and downstream oil and gas operations for any biological treatment ( Adham et al., 2018 ;   WEF, 2021 ). In recent years, the focus of MABR research has primarily been on municipal wastewater treatment,   which   has   generated   valuable   scientific   knowledge ( Guglielmi et al., 2020 ). Nonetheless, MABRs have demonstrated high effectiveness at both bench and pilot scales in treating various types of IWs,   either   as   standalone   MABRs   or   hybrid   MABR/CAS   systems ( Heffernan, 2024 ). In summary, the potential commercial application of MABRs at full scale is being evaluated for fit-for-purpose industrial ap -  plications, building on the knowledge acquired from municipal MABR systems ( Adapa, 2024 ).  6.   MABR challenges, innovations, and emission considerations  Although MABRs have shown promising performance in treating various types of IWs at bench and pilot scales, several challenges remain ( Dicataldo, 2015 ;   Li et al., 2015 ;   Syron and Casey, 2008a ;   Veleva et al., 2022 ;   Werkneh, 2022 ):  •   Biofilm growth control : managing biofilm growth, especially at the ends of modules and in the center of HF membrane bundles, is difficult. Periodic scouring with large bubbles is used, but BT opti -  mization for effective IW treatment and substrate distribution re -  mains challenging.  •   Biofilm attachment and stability:   Biofilm treatment stability is typically achieved 60 – 120 days after startup. The complexity of IWs suggests   that   certain   constituents   may   interfere   with   microbial attachment by altering surface charge, negatively impacting biofilm surface coverage. Evaluating factors that govern bacterial recruit -  ment and proliferation to the membrane surface is vital to decrease reactor start-up time to steady state of nutrient removal.  •   Bacteria layering mechanisms : fine-tuning the layering of bacte -  rial groups controlled by oxygen diffusion through the membrane is often a trial-and-error process.  •   Mixing energy requirements : adequate mixing energy is needed to ensure liquid distribution across all bundles. Outer edge HF mem -  branes, especially those exposed to incoming influent flows may receive higher carbon and nitrogen loads, while those towards the center may not, leading to imbalances in BT and performance.  •   Impact of shock loads : while steady-state performance for COD and NH 4  +   is less affected by shock loads, oils, high salinity, and toxic xenobiotics can alter biofilm structural integrity and biodiversity.  •   Scaling Up : there is still a significant lack of clarity regarding guidelines   for   scaling   up   membrane   modules   to   full-scale applications.  6.1.   Novel hybrid and emerging MABRs  Novel combinations of MABRs coupled with other water treatment technologies have been investigated. Hybrid MABRs include bacterial- algae biofilms to treat wider ranges of COD/N ratios ( Zhang et al., 2021 ), membrane bioreactors ( Silveira et al . , 2022 ), microbial elec -  trolysis cells ( De Paepe et al., 2020 ), activated carbon ( Wei et al., 2012 ), ceramsite sand ( Mei et al., 2019a ), and ozone/biological activated car -  bon ( Li et al., 2015 ). ZeeNAMMOX ™   (Veolia) is an emerging partial nitrification/Anammox   (PN/A)   biofilm   process   combined   with   the  G. Dicataldo et al.   Water   Research   280   (2025)   123523  10
ZeeLung ™   MABR. The PN/A is the most biologically efficient pathway for nitrogen removal ( Wang et al., 2021 ). The process converts NH 4  +   to NO 2 -   and N 2   gas using AOBs and anammox bacteria instead of a 2-step (AOB/NOB) nitrification and additional denitrification step. The PN/A process saves 57% in O 2   demand and 100% in sodium acetate as carbon source ( Long, 2023 ). The ZeeNAMMOX ™   promotes AOBs/Anammox and   suppresses   NOBs   by   controlling   the   OTR.   Long   et   al.   (2023)  demonstrated that ammonium oxidation rate (AOR) and total inorganic nitrogen removal rate (TINRR) are a function of OTR. With OTR   < 16 gO 2   m -2   d -1 , which is equivalent to AOR of around 7.5 gN m -2   d -1   the NOBs were suppressed. In addition, the theoretical TINRR/AOR ratio to suppress NOBs was 0.89 ( Long et al., 2023 ).  6.2.   N 2 O emission considerations  N 2 O emissions from biological treatment systems are a significant concern due to their impact on climate change and the ozone layer ( Kampschreur et al., 2009 ;   Kinh et al., 2017a ). Studies have shown that MABRs emit significantly less N 2 O compared to conventional suspended biological systems and co-current biofilm systems ( He and Daigger, 2023 ;   Kinh et al., 2017a ). For example, N 2 O emissions from hybrid MABRs were found to be one-fifth of those from CAS units ( He and Daigger, 2023 ). The main pathways for N 2 O production include AOB activity, heterotrophic denitrification, and abiotic chemical reactions ( Heil et al., 2014 ;   Schreiber et al., 2012 ;   Uri-Carre  ̃ no et al., 2024 ). Real-time measurements from full-scale MABR plants confirmed that N 2 O   emissions   are   primarily   due   to   nitrifier-nitrification   and nitrifier-denitrification pathways ( Uri-Carre  ̃ no et al., 2024 ).  7.   Conclusions  This paper critically reviews the feasibility of applying MABRs to more complex industrial wastewater treatment compared to municipal treatment. Key findings are included below.  •   Key advantages of MABR include higher oxygen transfer to reduce energy costs, lower emissions of GHGs, SND and carbon removal in one bioreactor, a more compact process and retrofitting capabilities.  •   Critical evaluation of vendors with full-scale experience was dis -  cussed highlighting the need for innovative designs to provide step changes in performance.  •   Extensive literature reviews demonstrate that bench and pilot-scale MABR systems are effective in removing xenobiotics and treating high-strength IWs, including those from pharmaceutical, chemical, refinery, petrochemical, oilfield, landfill leachate, and other sources. However, the adoption of MABR in industrial applications has been slow.  •   Key factors influencing MABR performance including BT has been shown to correlate well with COD and NH 4  +   removal in IW, indicating that a thicker biofilm seems to be more effective in carbon and ni -  trogen RE.  •   Current MABR models lack the resolution for large, dynamic systems. Future advancements must focus on real-time optimization and robust   biofilm   dynamics   representation   for   effective   industrial application.  •   Further research is needed to optimize MABR biofilm process con -  trol, substrate diffusion, modeling, and operational performance, confirming its feasibility for industrial applications with additional testing.

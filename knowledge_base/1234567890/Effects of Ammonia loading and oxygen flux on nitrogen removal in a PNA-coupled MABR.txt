But the research about the effects of aeration pressure and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the nitrogen removal performance are still deficient. In this study, the permeability of the hollow fiber membranes was firstly measured, with a value of 3067 g/(m 2 ⋅ MPa ⋅ d). The MABR was then operated for around 150 days under different aeration pressure and HRT conditions. At a low aeration pressure (0.012 MPa), HRT was shortened from 7.27 h to 4.07 h, providing sufficient substrates for functional microorganisms. Consequently, the ammonia removal rate and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal rate increased from 16.06 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) and 13.11 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) to 22.92 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) and 18.24 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d), respectively. As aeration pressure increased, TIN removal rate initially declined from 14 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) to 6 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d), then gradually improved to 11 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) due to the different activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB). Response surface methodology was used to visualize the effects of two operational parameters. Optimal conditions were found at an aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa and HRT of 6.75 h, achieving a predicted TIN removal efficiency of 49.99 %. These findings supported the practical applications of PNA-MABRs, and provide guidance for adjusting operational parameters to enhance nitrogen removal performance.  1.   Introduction  Membrane aerated biofilm reactors (MABRs) are a promising tech -  nology for domestic wastewater treatment [ 1 , 2 ]. Firstly, hollow fiber membranes, which are the core and crucial components of MABRs, transfer oxygen into bulk water in a bubbleless way. This results in extremely high oxygen transfer efficiency, significantly reducing aera -  tion energy cost [ 3 , 4 ]. Secondly, functional microorganisms can colo -  nize on the membrane surface. The biofilm environment is conducive to the proliferation of microorganisms with long doubling time, because the solid retention time (SRT) is long in MABRs [ 5 , 6 ]. The low sludge production also alleviates the problem of excessive sludge disposal, which is often difficult and costly [ 7 , 8 ]. Additionally, in MABRs, oxygen and contaminants diffuse in the opposite directions, a mechanism known as the counter-direction diffusion model [ 9 , 39 ].Multiple micro -  environments coexist within the biofilm, enabling processes such as simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND), partial nitrification and ANAMMOX (PNA) to occur in the reactors [ 10 – 13 ]. This facilitates the removal of nitrogenous contaminants in a single-stage reactor, reducing construction footprint and costs [ 14 – 16 ].  PNA process was a promising technology for wastewater treatment. In this process, AOB transfer a portion of ammonia to nitrite, and then anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) can convert ammonia and nitrite to dinitrogen gas via comproportionation [ 17 – 19 ]. Since both AOB and AnAOB are chemolithoautotrophic, PNA process does not require external organic matters, saving maintenance costs [ 20 – 22 ]. Furthermore, the sludge yield is low due to their relatively long doubling times. The previous studies have shown that the PNA process can cut  *   Corresponding author.  **   Correspondence to: C.

down 60 % aeration energy cost and 100 % organics dosage compared to conventional activated sludge processes [ 3 , 13 , 23 ].  Many   researchers   has   put   some   efforts   to   realize   PNA-coupled MABRs. Gong et al. [ 24 ] successfully achieved autotrophic nitrogen removal in a single-stage MABR, achieving a maximum volumetric removal rate of 0.77 kg N/(m 3 ⋅ d). They also analyzed the spatial dis -  tribution of various functional microorganisms using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. It was preliminarily confirmed the growth of AOB and AnAOB in the inner and outer layers of the biofilm, respectively. Adjusting aeration pressure can precisely control the oxy -  gen flux in MABRs. Many studies have verified that low dissolved oxy -  gen   (DO)   level   facilitate   the   formation   of   anoxic   or   anaerobic environments in the outer layer of biofilm, avoiding the inhibition ef -  fects on the AnAOB activity [ 11 , 25 ]. Under these conditions, nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) can be effectively inhibited, improving nitrite accumulation efficiency. Chen et al. [ 26 ] proposed the concept of   “ Zero Positive Pressure ” . MABRs were operated under extremely low aeration pressure ( < 0.005 MPa, gauge pressure) achieving nearly 100 % nitrite accumulation efficiency and stable NOB inhibition. ANAMMOX activity was induced in situ, resulting in a total nitrogen removal rate of 50   ±   13 g N/(m 3 ⋅ d). Ammonia loading rate is an important parameter to inhibit NOB and initiate PNA process in MABR [ 25 , 27 , 28 ], which was often regulated via HRT.  Despite their potential for nitrogen removal, PNA-MABRs still face some challenges that hinder their practical application and promotion. Oxygen and ammonia are two main substrates in the PNA process. Their fluxes can be regulated precisely in MABRs, affecting the diffusion gradient within the biofilm, altering the DO concentrations in different layers, and influencing the microbial activities [ 15 , 29 , 30 ]. Oxygen poses different effects on AOB and AnAOB because the electron accep -  tors are different in their metabolisms. Moreover, ammonia might in -  fluence the AOB activity to affect the oxygen diffusion gradient and AnAOB activity subsequently. This dynamic equilibrium with the bio -  film is susceptible and complicated to maintain. Practically, both aera -  tion pressure and HRT are important operational parameters in the practical engineering application of MABRs. However, the detailed ef -  fects and mechanisms remain unclear and further experimental evidence is needed.  In this study, the permeability of the hollow fiber membranes was firstly measured in order to characterize the theoretical oxygen flux under different aeration pressure. Then, two operational parameters, as aeration pressure and HRT, were adjusted in a PNA-MABR. The con -  centrations of contaminants were determined to reflect the nitrogen removal performance. The fluxes of substrates were calculated to esti -  mate the mass balances. Biofilm samples were collected and analyzed to better understand the microbial mechanism. Response surface meth -  odology was used to visualize the effects of these two parameters and optimize them. The aims of this study are to: (1) explore the effects of aeration pressure and HRT on reactor performance; (2) preliminarily explain the underlying mechanisms; and (3) seek the optimal opera -  tional parameters.  2.   Methods and materials  2.1.   Determination of oxygen transfer rate (OTR) and permeability  Within low DO ranges, the concentration of DO is linearly related to the aeration time, and the OTR can be obtained via the slope of the function expression. By varying the aeration pressure, a series of OTRs were determined. These OTRs were then normalized to the membrane surface area and aeration pressure to derive the permeability of the hollow fiber membrane [ 31 ]. Fig. S1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup to measure the oxygen permeability of the hollow fiber membranes (MHF-200TL, Mitsubishi, Japan), which has a pore size of 0.1 – 0.15   μ m and an outer diameter of 280   μ m. The total surface area was 5.89   ×   10     4   m 2 . A glass bottle was filled with a liter of deionized water. Nitrogen gas was bubbled into the water to deoxygenize until the DO concentration decreased to around 1 mg/L. Afterwards, we used a hollow fiber membrane module for aeration and recorded the DO value every minute. The bottle was sealed for isolation from the atmosphere during the whole operation.  2.2.   Reactor configuration and operational procedures  The configuration of the MABR in this study was based on the design described in Zhang et al. [ 32 ]. The PNA process was established in MABR 2, which served as the experimental setup for this research. The MABR possessed a volume of 1.57 L and the membrane module con -  tained 60 hollow fiber membranes (MHF-200TL, Mitsubishi, Japan) with a total surface area of 0.01055 m 2 . The synthetic wastewater contained the following contents per liter: NH 4 Cl 191 mg, NaHCO 3   1 g, KH 2 PO 4   0.0272 g, CaCl 2 ⋅ 2H 2 O 0.18 g, MgSO 4 ⋅ 7H 2 O 0.3 g, Trace I 1 mL, and Trace II 1 mL. Trace I (per liter) consisted of EDTA 5 g and FeSO 4   5 g. Trace II (per liter) consisted of EDTA-2Na 15 g, CuSO 4 ⋅ 5H 2 O 0.25 g, ZnSO 4 ⋅ 7H 2 O   0.43   g,   NaMoO 4 ⋅ 2H 2 O   0.22   g,   MnCl 2 ⋅ 4H 2 O   0.99   g, NiCl 2 ⋅ 6H 2 O 0.19 g, CoCl 2 ⋅ 6H 2 O 0.24 g, NaSeO 4 ⋅ 10H 2 O 0.21 g, and H 3 BO 4   0.014 g.  The operation of the MABR was divided into 9 phases based on different aeration pressures and HRTs. The aeration pressures were set sequentially at 0.012 MPa, 0.02 MPa, and 0.014 MPa. For each pressure setting,   the   HRTs   were   adjusted   to   7.27   h,   5.95   h,   and   4.07   h, respectively.  2.3.   Chemical analysis  Influent and effluent samples were filtered immediately via 0.22   μ m membrane filters and stored at 4   ◦ C in a refrigerator. Ammonia con -  centration was determined by cuvette tests based on the spectropho -  tometry   method   [ 33 ].   Nitrite   and   nitrate   concentrations   were determined by ion chromatography (ICS 2000, Dionex, USA). The total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) concentration was calculated as the sum of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate concentrations.  2.4.   Microbial analysis  Biofilm samples were collected on Day 250 (Phase 1; aeration pres -  sure of 0.012 MPa; HRT of 5.95 h;) and Day 336 (Phase 3; aeration pressure of 0.014 MPa; HRT of 4.07 h;) for DNA sequencing and analysis. The biofilm was peeled off from the membrane surface and resuspended into the centrifuge tube filled with medium. Then the samples were store in the refrigerator at       80   ◦ C. DNA sequencing was conducted by Novogene Institute (Beijing, China). Amplification and analysis of 16S rRNA was described in Zhang et al., [ 32 ].  2.5.   Response surface methodology (RSM) analysis  Experimental conditions and the results of ammonia removal effi -  ciency (ARE), ammonia removal rate (ARR), TIN removal efficiency (TINRE), and TIN removal rate (TINRR) were input to the Design Expert software. A quadratic regression equation was used for data fitting, and the resulting algebraic expression of the obtained functional relationship was imported into Originlab software for visualization.  2.6.

V (m 3 ) is the working volume of the reactor, and A (m 2 ) is the total surface area of the hollow fiber membranes.  Similarly, TIN Removal Efficiency and TIN Removal Rate could be obtained via the followings:  TINRE   ( % ) =   C TIN , inf       C TIN , eff  C TIN , inf  ×   100%   (2.4)  TINRR   [ g N /    m 2 ⋅ d ) ]   =   24   ×       C TIN , inf       C TIN , eff  )   ×   V 1000   ×   HRT   ×   A   (2.5)  C TIN,inf   (mg N/L) and C TIN,eff   (mg N/L) are the TIN concentrations in the influent and effluent, respectively.  Because there was no organics in the influent, heterotrophic deni -  trification was negligible. According to our previous study, TIN was almost removed solely by ANAMMOX pathway [ 32 ]. The activities of AOB, NOB, and AnAOB could be obtained by followings [ 7 ]:  r AOB   =   Δ NH +  4       1 2 . 06   Δ TIN HRT   (2.6)  r NOB   =   Δ NO    3       0 . 26 2 . 06   Δ TIN HRT   (2.7)  r AnAOB   =  1 . 32 2 . 06   Δ TIN HRT   (2.8)  Their activities were normalized to nitrite, which was contained in the metabolic reaction of all three microbial pathways.   Δ NH 4  + ,   Δ TIN, and   Δ NO 3      represent the difference of concentrations in the influent and the effluent.  3.   Results and discussion  3.1.   The permeability of hollow fiber membranes  Among the various operational parameters of MABR, the perme -  ability of hollow fiber membranes is of great importance and has a profound   impact   on treatment efficiency.   Perez-Calleja et al. [ 34 ] pointed out that oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) could approach nearly 100 % if MABRs use hollow fiber membranes with one end sealed for aeration. However, Nerenberg [ 35 ] mentioned that this configuration could be affected by gas reverse diffusion, which subsequently reduced the OTE. In this study, oxygen was supplied through two ends of the hollow fiber membranes.  As the aeration pressure increased from 0.02 MPa to 0.08 MPa, the  Fig. 1.

OTR raised up synchronously from 0.0554 mg/(L ⋅ min) to 0.1321 mg/ (L ⋅ min). After normalized to the membrane area, the range of oxygen transfer rate varied from 135.4 to 323.0 g/(m 2 ⋅ d). OTR was positively correlated to aeration pressure, as depicted by the functional expression in Fig. S2. Theoretical O 2   flux can be calculated to verify mass balance [ 36 ]. As aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa, 0.02 MPa, and 0.014 MPa, the OTRs   were   102.4   g/(m 2 ⋅ d),   127.0   g/(m 2 ⋅ d),   and   108.6   g/(m 2 ⋅ d), respectively. In other studies, the oxygen flux was determined to be in the range of 20 – 80 g/(m 2 ⋅ d) [ 34 , 37 , 38 ]. They operated the reactors under lower aeration pressure such as 0.004 and 0.007 MPa.  3.2.   The performance of the reactor  3.2.1.   The effects of HRTs on the nitrogen removal performance  The   startup   and   operation   of   the   PNA   process   in   MABR   were described in Zhang et al. [ 32 ], which was named MABR 2. In the end, an in situ batch experiment was conducted to determine the contribution of ANAMMOX   pathway   to   nitrogen   removal.   To   better   recover   and demonstrate the stable performance, the reactor ran under the pressure of 0.01 MPa and the HRT of 7.27 h, which was consistent with the Phase 4 in Zhang et al. [ 32 ]. The influent ammonia concentration was set at 50 mg N/L ( Fig. 1 ). During this phase, the ammonia loading rate was maintained at 27.2 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) ( Fig. 2 ). The effluent ammonia concen -  tration was ~ 25 mg N/L, resulting in an ammonia removal efficiency of ~ 50 %. The relatively high residual ammonia concentration indicated that the ammonia loading rate exceeded the practical nitrogen removal ability, which was likely restricted by AOB activity according to previ -  ous in situ batch experiments.  The ammonia loading rate was adjusted by changing the HRTs ( Fig. 1 ). In Phase 1, the HRT was maintained at 7.27 h, while the aeration pressure slightly increased to 0.012 MPa. The effluent ammonia concentration fluctuated, reaching a low value of 16.7 mg N/L before stabilizing at ~ 20.0 mg N/L. Compared with the baseline, this repre -  sented a decrease of only 3.2 mg N/L, indicating that the improvement was not significant. However, with higher ANAMMOX activity, the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate decreased from 1.7 mg N/L and 7.0 mg N/L to 0.8 mg N/L and 5.5 mg N/L, respectively. According to the stoichiometric ratio of the ANAMMOX [ 18 ], when 1.32 mol of NO 2      are reduced to N 2 , 0.26 mol of NO 3      are produced, resulting in a   Δ   NO 3      / Δ  NO 2      ratio of 0.197. In the process of nitrite oxidation to nitrate, NO 2      is almost completely converted to NO 3      , resulting in a   Δ   NO 3      / Δ   NO 2      close to 1. Comparing these values, the NO 3      production via the ANAMMOX pathway is 80 % lower than that of the nitrification process. The decrease in effluent NO 3      concentration indicated that more NO 2      was diverted to the ANAMMOX pathway. As shown in   Fig. 2 , the ammonia nitrogen removal rate increased from 16.3 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) to 18.2 g N/ (m 2 ⋅ d), representing an 11.7 % increase. Concurrently, the TIN removal rate increased from 11.9 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) to 13.4 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d), reflecting a 12.6 % increase. The slightly increased aeration pressure did not inhibit the activity of AnAOB. This might be attributed that AOB rapidly consumed oxygen within the biofilm, allowing AnAOB to keep growing in anoxic or anaerobic environments. This supports the hypothesis that increasing the oxygen flux of the hollow fiber membranes can enhance the   activity   of   AOB.   More   substrates   were   provided   for   AnAOB, strengthening their competitive advantage against NOB. As a result, more   ammonia   and   nitrite   were   consumed,   and   less   nitrate   was produced.  On Day 231, the HRT was reduced to 5.95 h, increasing the ammonia loading rate to ~ 30 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d), with a maximum of 33.6 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d). The effluent ammonia concentration initially increased to 30.0 mg N/L (on Day 233) due to a sudden influx of ammonia nitrogen. Functional microorganisms could not immediately absorb and utilize. However, over the next two weeks, the effluent ammonia concentration decreased to 16.1 mg N/L, and the ammonia removal rate and TIN removal rate increased from 43.5 % and 35.6 % to 65.4 % and 58.1 %, respectively. The ammonia removal rate and TIN removal rate peaked on Day 246, reaching 23.2 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) and 19.2 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d), respectively. Within a certain range (calculated by the semi saturation constant   K s ), the mi -  crobial metabolism activity is positively correlated with substrate con -  centration. Increasing the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the bulk water raised its diffusion gradient within the biofilm. The AOB in the inner biofilm layer were exposed to higher ammonia concentrations, enhancing their metabolic activity. They consumed more oxygen to protect the anoxic areas within the biofilm from DO, producing more NO 2      . ANAMMOX activity was protected and even promoted. The nitrate concentration trend was also noteworthy. On Day 232, the nitrate concentration decreased to 4.5 mg N/L due to dilution effect of the increased influx. Then, it slowly increased to 5.4 mg N/L, consistent with the NO 3      concentration before HRT was shortened. This indicated that the activity of NOB in the biofilm increased, and the same amount of nitrate was produced in a shorter time. The strong adaptability of NOB seriously affected the stability of the PNA process. Over the following fortnight, the NO 3      concentration continued to increase to 6.4 mg N/L. Enhanced NOB activity diverted nitrite from the ANAMMOX pathway, reducing   ammonia   utilization   by   AnAOB   and   increasing   effluent ammonia concentration. At this point, the reactor ’ s ARR and TINRR stabilized at ~ 20 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) and ~ 17 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d), respectively.  To explore the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor under extreme conditions, HRT was further shortened to 4.09 h, sharply increasing the ALR to 45 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d). The effluent ammonia concen -  tration was 28.3 mg N/L and remained relatively stable at 26.9 mg N/L after over ten days of operation. Ammonia and TIN removal rates showed slight increases, both rising by ~ 3 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d). At this loading rate, the ARR was significantly lower than the ALR, causing ARE to decreased from 55 % to 40 %, and TIN removal efficiency to decrease from 50 % to 37 %. Despite the high loading rate, the effluent nitrate concentration significantly decreased by 3.4 mg N/L on Day 265.  The influence of HRT persisted under varying aeration pressure, but the dilution effect of influent and DO had more direct and significant impacts on the effluent nitrogen species concentrations. These specific phenomena and rules are explained in Section 3.1.2.  3.2.2.   The effects of aeration pressure on the performance  On Day 272, the aeration pressure was adjusted to 0.02 MPa, and the HRT was extended to 7.27 h. At this stage, the ALR was ~ 26.8 g N/ (m 2 ⋅ d). Evidently, excessive oxygen had a negative impact on the re -  actor ’ s nitrogen removal performance. From Day 273 to Day 282, the effluent ammonia concentration remained relatively low (18 – 20 mg N/ L), with ARE and TINRE stable at 60 % and 50 %, respectively. This stability was due to the growth and reproduction of functional micro -  organisms in the biofilm under the previous aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa, which had improved nitrogen removal performance. After the aeration pressure was switched to 0.02 MPa, the ARR initially remained unchanged at 18.6 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d). However, the TINRR showed a down -  ward trend, decreasing from 16.5 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) to 14.0 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d). High aeration pressure facilitated oxygen diffusing to the outer biofilm layer, shrinking the anoxic and anaerobic zones. AOB activity was promoted, hence no significant change was shown in ARR. AnAOB activity was inhibited, resulting in a decrease TINRR. The effluent nitrate concen -  tration increased to 8.6 mg N/L, ~ 2 mg N/L higher than that of the previous stage with an aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa and an HRT of 7.27 h. Over the subsequent 30 days, the nitrate concentration increased by ~ 3 mg N/L, indicating that NOB accumulated and proliferated in the biofilm, occupying a stable ecological niche. Biofilms functioned as buffers, resisting adverse factors, and free ammonia in the aqueous phase could not effectively inhibit the activity of NOB.  The HRT was shortened to 5.95 h and 4.07 h, increasing the ALR to 31.8 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) and 41.6 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d). The effluent ammonia concen -  tration increased to 22 mg N/L and 28 mg N/L, respectively. Subse -  quently, ARE continued to decrease rapidly from 40 % to 30 %. As seen in   Fig. 2 , the decrease in ARR was not significant, remaining at 16.6 g N/ (m 2 ⋅ d) on Day 300. But it was clearly observed that the TINRR of the  J.-F. Zhang et al.   Journal   of   Water   Process   Engineering   70   (2025)   106981  4
reactor further decreased significantly, approaching 10 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) at its lowest point. Higher aeration pressure promoted AOB activity while inhibiting AnAOB activity, resulting in different trends of ARR and TINRR.  Due to the inhibitory effect of 0.02 MPa aeration pressure on TIN removal efficiency, the aeration pressure was switched to 0.014 MPa on Day 301 to further explore the effect of aeration pressure within the range of 0.012 – 0.02 MPa. Under the first two HRT conditions, the effluent ammonia concentration remained stable at ~ 25 mg N/L, with ARE fluctuating between 43 % and 47 %. TINRE gradually increased from 27 % to 39 %. When the HRT was 4.09 h (Day 328), ammonia concentration in the effluent temporarily increased to 35.2 mg N/L before falling back to 31.1 mg N/L. ARE dropped to 26.4 % and slowly rebounded to 35.6 %. Although O 2   flux decreased and resulted in less ammonia converted by AOB, AnAOB activity slowly recovered from the high DO concentration shock. Consequently, ARR and TINRR gradually increased from 12.24 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) and 6.37 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d) to 16.70 g N/ (m 2 ⋅ d) and 11.79 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d), respectively. From Day 320, nitrogen removal performance gradually stabilized, but it was lower than that under the aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa. Comparing the TIN removal performance under three aeration conditions, 0.012 MPa might be within the optimal range of aeration pressure.  To convert 1 mol NH 4  +   to NO 3      needs approximately 2 mol O 2 , which means converting 1 mg N/L NH 4  +   requires 4.571 mg/L O 2 . Considering a TINRE of 50 % and the stoichiometric ratio of ANAMMOX, around 15.6 mg N/L NO 2      and 2.0 mg N/L NO 3      were generated via nitrification pathway. Thus, around 62.6 mg/L O 2   was consumed, resulting in an oxygen flux of 23.9 g/(m 2 ⋅ d). This is 35 % lower than the theoretical oxygen flux in an aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa. The reason causing this result might be that oxygen diffused directly into bulk water from the   membrane surface in   the   OTR determination experiment.   The membrane-water interface renewed timely because of stirring. So, the driving force was relatively high, and diffusion resistance was low. When biofilm formed on the membrane surface, diffusion resistance upsurged significantly, resulting in a much lower actual oxygen flux.  3.2.3.   Microbial community structure of the biofilm  Nitrosomonas ,   Nitrospira , and   Candidatus   Brocadia were the main functional microorganisms within the biofilm, whereas their abun -  dances varied in different phases ( Fig. 3 ). On Day 250, the ARR and  Fig. 3.   Microbial community structure of the biofilm samples.  J.-F. Zhang et al.   Journal   of   Water   Process   Engineering   70   (2025)   106981  5
TINRR both peaked throughout the whole operation. The abundance of  Nitrosomonas   was 6.73 %, while those of   Nitrospira   and   Candidatus  Brocadia were 1.45 % and 7.24 %, respectively. This indicated that ammonia was converted via PNA pathway, and small part of nitrite was transferred to nitrate by   Nitrospira . Under aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa, the reactor had satisfying performance due to suitable microbial community structure. On Day 336, when the aeration pressure was 0.14 MPa, the abundances of   Nitrosomonas   and   Nitrospira   increased to 10.56 % and 2.75 %, respectively. It implied that nitrifiers activities were upregulated with higher aeration pressure. Unfortunately, the abun -  dance of   Candidatus   Brocadia decreased to 1.56 % instead, resulting in the deterioration of the TIN removal performance. The metabolic ac -  tivity and growth of AnAOB are susceptible to DO concentration. They will be inhibited when exposed to high DO concentration environment. Although   AOB   in   the   biofilm   consume   oxygen   rapidly,   protecting AnAOB from the oxygen impact, this buffer effect is limited. Regulating aeration pressure is more complicated to optimize the nitrogen removal performance. In this study, aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa was optimal, simultaneously promoting the activity of AOB and AnAOB.  3.3.   The optimalization of parameters by RSM  This experiment set three HRTs under three different aeration pres -  sure conditions, and analyzed the effect of operating parameters on the nitrogen removal performance using response surface methodology. The influencing variable   a   is lumen pressure (MPa),   b   is HRT (h), and the response variables   y 1 ,   y 2 ,   y 3 , and   y 4   are ammonia removal efficiency (ARE, %), ammonia removal rate (ARR, g N/(m 2 ⋅ d)), TIN removal effi -  ciency (TINRE, %), and TIN removal rate (TINRR, g N/(m 2 ⋅ d)), respec -  tively.   The   specific   response   surface   analysis   experimental   design scheme is shown in Table S1. In the Design Expert software, the rela -  tionship between influencing variables and response variables was fitted. Multiple regression analysis was used to simulate and calculate the surface expressions of each variable (Text S2).  Fig. S3 shows the linear correlation between the predicted values of the model and the actual values, where (a), (b), (c), and (d) correspond to the response variables   y 1 , y 2 ,   y 3 , and   y 4 , respectively. From the graph, it can be observed that the predicted values of the model were close to the straight line and evenly distributed on both sides of the line, indi -  cating a strong correlation between the predicted values of the model and the actual values. Fig. S4 shows the normal probability plot of external studentized residuals. The external studentized residuals for ARE, ARR, TINRE, and TINRR fit well along a straight line, with most data points plotting on the line, indicating that the model fitted well and followed a normal distribution.  A response surface graph was plotted based on the algebraic ex -  pressions between the four response variables and influencing variables, namely ARE, ARR, TINRE, and TINRR ( Fig. 4   and S5). This intuitively displayed the influence of aeration pressure and HRT on each response variable. The response surfaces formed by the four response variables and the influencing variables were all saddle-shaped, showing that the effects of aeration pressure and HRT were nearly opposite. As the aeration pressure increased, all response variables first decreased and then increased, whereas the response to increasing HRT followed a different pattern.  When the aeration pressure was fixed and HRT was shortened, there was a slight increase in ARE, which then rapidly decreased after peak -  ing, while ARR showed an upward trend during this process. This indicated that the increase in ALR exceeded the microbial metabolic activity. At an aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa, as HRT gradually decreased   to   about   4 – 5   h,   the   increase   in   ARR   slowed,   almost approaching a plateau. After the aeration pressure was raised, the AnAOB activity started to be inhibited, leading to decreases in ARE and ARR. The surplus oxygen flux significantly enhanced AOB activity, which partially compensated for the inhibition of ANAMMOX, aligning with the changes in physicochemical data.  The changes in TINRE and TINRR followed a similar pattern. At low aeration pressure, a significant peak in TINRE occurred with HRT variation. Near this peak, microbial activity and ALR formed a subtle balance, achieving good nitrogen removal performance. When aeration pressure increased, AnAOB activity was inhibited, decreasing TINRR. However, as aeration pressure continued to rise, TINRR showed an  Fig. 4.   Response surface methodology analysis of ammonia removal efficiency and ammonia removal rate.  J.-F. Zhang et al.

abnormal increase, warranting further detailed exploration in the future experiments.  The expected maximum TIN removal efficiency was calculated by the Design Expert software under various aeration pressures and HRTs ( Fig. 5 ). The optimal TINRE were determined to be an aeration pressure of 0.012 MPa and an HRT of 6.75 h, with a predicted model value of 49.99 %. Taking TINRR as the optimization objective, the conditions of 0.012 MPa aeration pressure and 4.09 h HRT yielded a predicted TINRR model value of 17.82 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d). The RSM analysis reflects that to obtain ideal nitrogen removal performance needs good and subtle adjustment of each operational parameters.  3.4.   Potential mechanisms  Aeration pressure and HRT influenced the nitrogen removal perfor -  mance via different mechanisms.   Fig. 6   shows the changes of N cycle with different aeration pressure. When it was set at 0.012 MPa, AOB consumed O 2   timely and transferred ammonia into nitrite, supplying affluent   substrate   to   AnAOB.   Ammonia   was   finally   removed   by ANAMMOX pathway. Although there was nitrate produced by NOB, their activities remained low and were inhibited. High DO could pro -  mote the activity of AOB, while it harmed the growth of AnAOB as they preferred anaerobic environment. Raising the aeration pressure dimin -  ished the anaerobic/anoxic layer and lowered the activity of AnAOB, even causing irreversible damage. Consequently, the nitrogen removal performance deteriorated and even accelerated the growth of NOB. More nitrite was converted to nitrate and partial nitrification system broke down. As the ammonia concentration in the influent was set at 50 mg N/L, it would not inhibit the functional microbes. Once the ammonia loading rate was higher than the maximal activities of AOB and AnAOB, the ammonia concentration in the effluent would rise. To obtain a satisfying performance, PNA-MABRs should be operated with relatively low aeration pressure. Then HRT should be regulated according to the practical water quality of the effluent.  4.   Conclusion  This study explored the effects of aeration pressure and HRT on the performance   of   the   PNA-MABR.   The   following   conclusions   are summarized:  (1) The permeability of the hollow fiber membranes in clear water was measured. Aeration pressure has a strong positive correlation with oxygen flux, with a permeability of 3067 g/(m 2 ⋅ MPa ⋅ d).  (2) Short HRT could provide sufficient substrates for functional mi -  croorganisms   to   promote   their   proliferation.   During   the   gradual increasing of aeration pressure, AOB became more active, but the ac -  tivity of AnAOB decreased, resulting the ammonia removal rate in a trend of first decreasing and then increasing.  (3) The RSM analysis showed that the optimal aeration pressure was 0.012 MPa. The optimal HRT, however, varied according to different targets. When the HRT was 6.75 h, the predicted model value of the TIN removal efficiency was 49.99 %. When HRT was 4.09 h, the predicted model value of TIN removal rate was 17.82 g N/(m 2 ⋅ d).

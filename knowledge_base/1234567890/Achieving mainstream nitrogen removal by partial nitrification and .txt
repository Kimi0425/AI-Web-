The inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) remains as the most significant challenge for its development. In our investigation, we proposed a novel process to integrate carriers to MABR (CMABR), which combined the carriers enriched with anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) and partial nitrifying MABR system. The effect of different hydraulic retention time (HRT) was explored in CMABR and it showed that the nitrogen removal rate of CMABR could reach more than 200 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d) at an HRT of 3 h The increase of NOB activity was witnessed when the residual NH 4  + -N concentration was lower than 5 mg-N/L. Finally, the higher nitrogen removal rate and successful PN/A can be achieved by optimized condition through the operation of two-stage CMABRs with 30 % of carriers filling ratio and a total HRT of 6 h Superior NH 4  + -N removal efficiency (97 %) and total nitrogen removal effi -  ciency (81 %) were reached compared with other MABR for PN/A processes. The CMABR exerted the special advantage that significant AnAOB attached on the carriers, rather than only on the membrane biofilm, thus it was beneficial to maintain the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and improve the nitrogen removal rate and effluent quality. This investigation provides creative and significant perspectives for the design and oper -  ation of PN/A processes in the future MABR applications.  1.   Introduction  Membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) is becoming more and more attractive for removing nitrogen in wastewater treatment process due to its attractive advantages of low energy consumption and high oxygen transfer rate ( Werkneh, 2022 ). The combination of MABR with other energy-efficiency nitrogen removal technologies, such as partial nitrification-anammox (PN/A), would extensively expand its applica -  tion ( Li et al., 2023b ). Recently, implementing PN/A process to MABR enables extremely low oxygen and carbon consumption, which has received extensive research and attention ( Lackner et al., 2014 ;   Li et al., 2023 ;   Wagner et al., 2022 ;   Lu et al., 2023 ). However, the proliferation of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) still presents as the most significant challenge. Current studies mainly focus on the NOB suppression stra -  tegies to cognitive the mechanisms for a stable PN. Restricting the oxygen supply was widely recognized to ensure an anoxic condition in the bulk liquid to inhibit NOB growth. Operating a relatively low lumen air pressure, intermittent aeration or closed-end air supply mode were proved to be conductive to NOB inhibition ( Bunse et al., 2024 ;   Chen et al., 2022 ;   Ma et al., 2022 ;   Wang et al., 2024 ). In addition, hydraulic retention time (HRT) was relative to substrate surface loads (nitro -  gen/oxygen) ( Bunse et al., 2020 ;   Pellicer-n ` acher et al., 2014 ), and a relatively lower HRT or higher loading rate was recommended to keep higher ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity, further inhibit NOB ( Wang et al., 2024 ;   Duan et al., 2023 ). The control of biomass attach -  ment on the biofilm, the free ammonia or free nitrous acid inhibition were also common strategies for a stable PN performance ( Bunse et al., 2020 ;   Wang et al., 2023 ;   Zuo et al., 2024 ).  The implementation of PN/A in MABR is challengeable as well since it   is   necessary   to   enrich   AOB   and   anaerobic   ammonium-oxidizing  *   Corresponding author.

bacteria (AnAOB) while inhibiting NOB proliferation. The existence subsistent contradictions mainly lie on two aspects. On one hand, a thick anoxic biofilm was necessary for the microbial activity of AnAOB to assure a high-efficiency nitrogen removal ( Strous et al., 1998 ;   Wagner et al., 2022 ), which may hinder a higher mass transfer between the bulk liquid and aerobic biofilm ( Sanchez-Huerta et al., 2023 ). On the other hand, the requirement of low effluent concentration of NH 4  + -N probably induced the insufficient activity of AOB or AnAOB, which was very likely to result in the growth of NOB ( Yang et al., 2023 ;   Zheng et al., 2023 ). Thus, a clear understanding of well-designed parameters and underlying mechanisms are prerequisite for a successful PN/A process.  Recently, some researchers have reported PN/A in MABR, but the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration was difficult to stabilize below 5 mg-N/L for the discharge level, and the HRT was in the range of 12 – 24 h, thus, the nitrogen removal rates were low ( Bunse et al., 2020 ;   Chen and Zhou, 2022 ;   Li et al., 2023b ;   Li et al., 2016 ;   Zhao et al., 2021 ). The main reason can be ascribed to the contradiction that under the combined effect of the low NH 4  + -N concentration in the bulk liquid and the high mass transfer resistance of the outer biofilm. Thus, it would induce low NH 4  + -N concentration in the inner aerobic zone, further result in lower AOB activity and ammonia oxidation rate, and finally lead to the lower nitrogen removal rate and PN/A deterioration. Therefore, we proposed to build a carriers-coupled MABR (named CMABR) to optimize the ni -  trogen removal efficiency by PN/A. Thereinto, the membrane biofilm was supposed to be enriched with AOB for PN process and the carriers located in the anoxic bulk liquid attached with large amount of AnAOB was managed to complete the anaerobic ammonium oxidation process. Under this structure, both AOB and AnAOB were assumed to maintain high activity for a successful system performance.  Above all, this study aimed to optimize the PN/A performance by proposing CMABR system, and mainly investigated: 1) the effects and mechanisms of HRT on nitrogen removal efficiency and NOB inhibition in the CMABR; 2) the strategy to improve the CMABR for successful mainstream nitrogen removal; 3) the microbial community under the optimized condition. This study gives the perspectives on balancing the remaining NH 4  + -N concentration in the bulk liquid and NOB inhibition by optimizing operational conditions and system design, which would further improve our understanding of NOB inhibition on biofilm by control-based strategies and shed light on the future application of MABR for a more sustainable wastewater treatment process by auto -  trophic nitrogen removal.  2.   Materials and methods  2.1.   System configuration and operation  Lab-scale MABRs were employed in this study ( Fig. 1 ). Each reactor was a plexiglass cylinder with membrane module consisted of 12 tubular silicone membranes. The membrane had the length of 350 mm, the outer diameter of 4 mm and the inner diameter of 3 mm, and the outside surface was covered by non-woven fabrics made of fiber yarn to improve the stability of the membrane module and enhance the adhesion of microorganisms. The effective volume of the reactor was about 0.98 L which caused a membrane area ratio of 54 m 2 /m 3 . After the stable PN achieved in MABR, the carriers enriched with AnAOB was employed (carriers-MABR, i.e. CMABR) for realizing nitrogen removal by PN/A ( Fig. 1 ). The cube carriers were made of polyurethane sponge material with an average side length of about 20 mm, a specific surface area of  > 4000 m 2 /m 3 . An effective filling ratio of 30 % was added to MABR, and the ratio was referred to   Gilbert et al., (2015)   in PN/A process. In this study, the sponge carriers enriched with AnAOB were inoculated be -  forehand in a tank of 500 L with highly active AnAOB, which was mainly in the biofilm of carriers. The inoculation process for realizing stable attachment on the carriers was around one month.  The synthetic wastewater was employed as influent with the NH 4  + -N concentration about 50 mg-N/L and no organic carbon source addition. The detailed components were shown in the previous research ( Wang et al., 2024 ). For the operation process, the fast start-up strategy of PN in MABR proposed in our research was adopted ( Wang et al., 2024 ). Briefly, the influent was with high NH 4  + -N load and the HRT was of 3 h The open-end aeration mode was applied in the first 10 days and closed-end mode was switched subsequently, by which MABR main -  tained stable NOB inhibition. After the start-up period, the carriers with enriched AnAOB were put into the MABR (CMABR) on day 12 – 16.  In this study, the nitrogen removal effects of single-stage CMABR and two-stage   CMABRs   were   investigated   respectively.   The   effect   of  Fig. 1.   Carriers-coupled MABR (CMABR) diagram: (a) schematic design; (b) operational device.  L. Wang et al.   Water   Research   271   (2025)   123000  2
different HRTs from 6 h to 3 h was explored in the single-stage CMABR. The two-stage CMABRs consisted of two CMABRs and each with the HRT of 3 h, and the effluent of the first CMABR was used as the influent of the second-stage CMABR, which led to a total HRT of 6 h The temperature was set at 30   ◦ C to maintain stable AnAOB activity. The circulation flow rate was set as 60 mL/min, and an additional parameter was explored to investigate the effect of internal recycle on the PN/A performance (Supporting Information (SI)).  2.2.   Analytical methods  Samples of the influent and effluent were collected everyday and filtered with 0.45   μ m filters (Millipore). The concentrations of NH 4  + -N, NO 2      -N, and NO 3      -N were measured according to the standard methods with a multimode microplate reader (Victor Nivo Basic S, PerkinElmer, USA)   ( APHA,   2005 ).   Dissolved   oxygen   (DO)   concentration   was measured   online   with   a   portable   multimeter   (pH/Oxi340i,   WTW, Germany).  2.3.   Evaluation of nitrogen removal  In order to evaluate the performance of nitrification and nitrogen removal in the system, the NH 4  + -N removal efficiency, nitrogen removal rate and total nitrogen removal efficiency were calculated. The calcu -  lation methods of them were as follows:  ARE   =   S NH +  4       N , inf       S NH +  4       N  S NH +  4       N , inf  ×   100%   (1)  NRR   =   24   × ( S TN ,   inf       S TN  )  HRT   (2)  NRE   =   S TN ,   inf       S TN  S TN ,   inf  ×   100%   (3)  ARE   was the NH 4  + -N removal efficiency,   NRR   was the nitrogen removal rate (g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d)),   NRE   represented total nitrogen removal ef -  ficiency (%);   S NH +  4       N , inf   (mg/L) and   S NH +  4       N   (mg/L) were the concentra -  tions of NH 4  + -N in the influent and bulk liquid, respectively;   S TN , inf   and  S TN   were the total nitrogen concentrations of the influent and bulk liquid respectively (mg-N/L), and HRT was the hydraulic retention time (h).  2.4.   Determination of AOB and NOB activities  In this study, the activities of AOB and NOB can be estimated based on the stoichiometric relationship of the nitrification and PN/A. In the PN/A process, the ratio of NH 4  + -N removal rate, NO 2      -N removal rate and NO 3      -N generation rate were not fixed. Under lower nitrogen load of influent, the ratio was close to 1:1.133:0.161 ( Zhang et al., 2018 ). Thus, the activities of AOB and NOB of the system could be calculated as   Eq. (4)   and   (5) :  q NOB   =   24   × ( S NO    3       N       0 . 0821 ( S TN ,   inf       S TN ))  HRT   (4)  q AOB   =   24   ×   0 . 596   × ( S TN ,   inf       S TN  )  HRT   +   q NOB   (5)  where   q AOB   and   q NOB   represented the AOB and NOB activities (g-N/ (m 3 ⋅ d)), respectively.   S NO    3       N   (mg/L) was the concentration of NO 3      -N in the bulk liquid.  2.5.   DNA sequencing  Microbial samples of the biofilms were collected from the membrane and carriers of first-stage CMABR and second-stage CMABR, respectively on day 50 to investigate the microbial community under the optimized operational condition. The microbial genera and their relative abun -  dances were identified by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing, and the specific protocol was followed by   Wang et al. (2023) .  3.   Results and discussions  3.1.   The effect of HRT on the CMABR  Fig. 2   showed the effect of HRT on the PN/A performance in single- stage CMABR, and the AnAOB carriers were added on day 12. It can be seen that stable PN was achieved in MABR before day 12 with the strategy of closed-end aeration mode. At the HRT of 3 h, the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration was about 40 mg-N/L and NO 2      -N concentration was about 10 mg-N/L, thus NH 4  + -N removal efficiency was about 20 % and all of the NH 4  + -N was transferred to nitrite with almost no nitrogen removal. After the addition of AnAOB carriers, the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration   dropped   significantly   to   21.5   mg-N/L,   and   NH 4  + -N removal efficiency reached nearly 60 %. The NO 2      -N concentration decreased to 1.2 mg-N/L, which indicated AnAOB had sufficient quan -  tity and activity to remove NH 4  + -N and NO 2      -N simultaneously through PN/A. Due to the production of NO 3      -N by PN/A, the average effluent NO 3      -N concentration increased to 2.1 mg-N/L.  With   the   increase   of   HRT,   the   effluent   NH 4  + -N   concentration decreased gradually, and the NO 3      -N concentration increased slightly. When the HRT was 5 h, the average effluent NH 4  + -N concentration decreased to 5.6 ± 1.3 mg-N/L, and the NO 3      -N concentration in the effluent was 6.8 ± 0.9 mg-N/L. Due to no NO 2      -N accumulation, the total nitrogen concentration in the effluent was 12.4 ± 1.6 mg-N/L, and the total nitrogen removal efficiency was about 75 %. When the HRT was increased to 5.5 h, the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration was 3.9   ±   1.6 mg- N/L, which was not stable enough to totally meet the urban sewage discharge level A discharge standard (5 mg-N/L) in China. Further increasing HRT to 6 h, the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration of MABR decreased to 0.73   ±   0.44 mg-N/L, NO 3      -N increased to 9.2   ±   1.2 mg-N/L and the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 79.7 %. Thus, both effluent NH 4  + -N and total nitrogen concentrations reached the Class A standard. However, the increase of nitrate was found around day 80, and low NH 4  + -N concentration in the bulk liquid may limit the activity of AOB, thus, it would be further discussed in   Section 3.2 .  Fig. 3   showed the average nitrogen removal rate, NH 4  + -N concen -  tration and NO 2      -N concentration in the bulk liquid at different HRTs. Since no organic matter was added to the influent, the total nitrogen removal in MABR was mainly removed by AnAOB (probably a very small amount of endogenous denitrification). Therefore, the total ni -  trogen removal efficiency could be assumed as the nitrogen removal efficiency of AnAOB.  When the HRT was 3 h, the nitrogen removal rate was about 200 g- N/(m 3 ⋅ d). Then the HRT increased to 5 h, the nitrogen removal rate began to decrease and reached 180.9 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d), indicating that the activities of AOB and AnAOB began to be inhibited under this condition. The concentration of the intermediate product NO 2      -N was close to 0, which suggested that the PN of AOB was the rate-limiting step. The main reason for the limited activity of AOB could be due to its low substrate concentration. Thus, the NO 2      -N produced could not meet the con -  sumption of AnAOB, which resulted in the activity of AnAOB decreasing by 10 %. Although the decrease of NH 4  + -N concentration led to a decrease in nitrogen removal rate, the specific nitrogen removal rate of the CMABR reached 3.35 g-N/(m 2 ⋅ d), which was much higher than that of the traditional MABR. In comparison, when the NH 4  + -N concentration was about 5 mg-N/L, the specific nitrogen removal rates obtained by other investigations were 1.9 g-N/(m 2 ⋅ d) ( Bunse et al., 2020 ), 0.91 g-N/(m 2 ⋅ d) ( Li et al., 2023 ) and 0.65 g-N/(m 2 ⋅ d) ( Zhao et al., 2021 ), respectively. Since traditional MABR enriched with AnAOB in the outer layer of the membrane, which increased the thickness of the anoxic zone in the outer layer, and the mass transfer resistance of NH 4  + -N from the bulk liquid to the aerobic zone of the biofilm increased as well. Further,  L. Wang et al.   Water   Research   271   (2025)   123000  3
NH 4  + -N concentration in the aerobic zone of the biofilm was reduced, inducing more serious AOB limitation. The CMABR exerted the advan -  tage that significant AnAOB attached on the carriers, rather than only on the membrane biofilm. Since the carriers didn ’ t hinder the mass transfer of NH 4  + -N, it can maintain the activity of AOB and improve the nitrogen removal rate.  When the HRT was increased to 6 h, the NH 4  + -N concentration decreased to 0.73 mg-N/L, and the nitrogen removal rate decreased to 158.2 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d), which was only 21 % lower than the nitrogen removal rate when the NH 4  + -N concentration was over 20 mg-N/L. This suggested that on one hand, the NH 4  + -N concentration in the biofilm didn ’ t decrease too much than that in the bulk liquid; on the other hand, the number of AOB might have increased. Our previous results supposed that with the decreasing specific activity of AOB by low NH 4  + -N con -  centration, the thickness of the aerobic biofilm (i.e., the number of AOB) gradually increased ( Wang et al., 2024 ), thereby alleviating the effect of reduced NH 4  + -N concentration on the total nitrogen removal efficiency. The above results exerted the specific advantage of CMABR that due to significant growth of AnAOB on the carriers, neither the mass transfer of NH 4  + -N nor the expansion of aerobic biofilm was obviously affected.  In summary, when HRT increased from 3 h to 6 h gradually, the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration gradually decreased from 20 mg-N/L to below 1 mg-N/L, and the activities of AOB and AnAOB also decreased due to the limitation of their activities under low substrate concentra -  tion. However, due to the structural advantage of CMABR, the nitrogen removal rate at extremely low NH 4  + -N concentration was only 21 % lower than that of high NH 4  + -N concentration.  3.2.   The mechanism of NOB inhibition in the CMABR  In PN process, based on the effect of DO distribution in the biofilm on the competition of AOB and NOB in   Wang et al., (2024) , a relatively higher concentration of NH 4  + -N in the bulk liquid was conductive to NOB inhibition. The key to inhibit NOB was to limit the DO concentration of the inner layer of the biofilm, by which to realize the outcompeting of AOB to NOB. However, in the PN/A process, the decrease concentration of NH 4  + -N will weaken the activity of AOB, and the lower nitrite con -  centration will inhibit NOB to a degree. Thus, in this study, the mech -  anisms of AOB and NOB activities were analyzed with the increase of HRT and the decrease of NH 4  + -N after the inoculation of AnAOB. Ac -  cording to the effluent quality in   Fig. 2 , the activities of AOB and NOB in CMABR at different HRTs can be calculated based on the stoichiometric relationship of PN/A process ( Fig. 4 ). It can be found in   Table 1   that when HRT was 3 h, the activity of AOB can increase to 150.4 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d), and the activity of NOB showed a decrease trend to 0 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d). When the HRT increased to 4 h, the activity of AOB was first inhibited to 124.9 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d), then recovered to 140.5 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d). The activity of NOB increased to 14.2 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d), then decreased to 10.2 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d) due to the competition of oxygen between AOB and NOB. Further, the HRT was proceeded to 5 h, 5.5 h and 6 h subsequently, it was interesting that after the increase of HRT in each period, the AOB activity was first inhibited, then recovered slowly, but never exceeded the maximum activity at the previous HRT. Meanwhile, the NOB activity increased within a few days after the HRT increased, then showed a downward trend.  The above change of AOB and NOB activities could be explained by the change of substrate and DO concentration in the biofilm ( Fig. 5 ). First, the increase of HRT would induce a decrease of the concentration of NH 4  + -N in the bulk liquid, which in turn led to the decrease of AOB  Fig. 2.   Nitrogen removal under different HRT conditions in CMABR.  Fig. 3.   The nitrogen removal rate, the concentrations of NH 4  + -N and NO 2      -N in CMABR at different HRTs.  L. Wang et al.   Water   Research   271   (2025)   123000  4
activity (i.e. the oxygen utilization rate) ( Fig. 5 a), and the increase of DO in the aerobic biofilm decreased afterwards ( Fig. 5 a & b). According to the result of   Wang et al. (2024) , the DO concentration in the biofilm increased because the lower the oxygen transfer rate (equal to the ox -  ygen utilization rate), the higher the DO concentration at the interface of membrane and biofilm, and the smaller the   oxygen concentration gradient in the biofilm, which further resulted in an overall increase in the DO concentration in the biofilm. Thus, both AOB and NOB would grow in the outermost layer of the biofilm as the DO concentration in the biofilm increased ( Fig. 5 b), which corresponded to the increase of AOB and NOB activities with the initial increase of each HRT in this study. Then, as the number of AOB and NOB increased, the utilization rate of oxygen in the biofilm also increased, and the DO concentration in the biofilm would decrease again ( Fig. 5 b & c). However, due to the increase of the mass transfer resistance in the biofilm to oxygen, the oxygen transfer rate would be slightly lower than that before HRT elevated ( Fig. 5 c). Finally, as the DO concentration of the outer biofilm dropped to 0 again, the activity of NOB in the outer biofilm would be inhibited ( Fig. 5 c & d), which explained the decrease in NOB activity at the late stage under each HRT conditions in   Fig. 4 . It can be suggested that under the combined inhibition of low concentrations of DO and NO 2      -N, if the synthesis rate of NOB was lower than the endogenous respiration rate, the number of NOB would gradually decrease with cell decay until the balance of the growth and decay, and the number of NOB and the ac -  tivity would be stable to a certain value. Thus, the mechanisms of NOB inhibition can be ascribed to two reasons: the low oxygen concentration in the biofilm due to the competition of AOB and a low NO 2      -N con -  centration in the bulk liquid due to the consumption by AnAOB.  As shown in   Fig. 4 , in the later stages with HRT   ≤   5.5 h, NOB activity showed a decreased trend, which was able to achieve the balance of NOB activity and maintain stable PN/A.   Duan et al., (2023)   also indicated that high hydraulic loading rate was beneficial for NOB suppression by restricting DO penetration. However, under these HRTs, the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration could not meet the discharge level of 5 mg-N/L ( Fig. 3 ). On the contrary, when the HRT was 6 h, the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration of MABR dropped to below 1 mg-N/, but the NOB activity showed a continuous growing trend. In order to investigate whether the effluent of CMABR could meet the discharge level while achieving stable NOB inhibition at an HRT of 6 h in a long term, the device was kept running for 70 days (day 55 – 125) ( Section 1   in SI). It can be seen clearly that the activity of NOB continued to increase (Fig. S1b), which might be due to the inhibition of AOB by low NH 4  + -N concentration (Fig. S1a), and it led to an aerobic state in outermost layer of the biofilm for a long time ( Fig. 5 b). Thus, it induced to a continuous increase in the number of NOB. Around day 70, the highly active NOB began to compete with AnAOB for NO 2      -N, resulting in the inhibition of AnAOB activity, and an increase of effluent NH 4  + -N concentration was observed. Finally, the total nitrogen removal efficiency dropped to 42.6 %. This result was consistent with the research of   Lu et al., (2023) , which showed the presence of AnAOB would suppress NOB to a degree, but it was inca -  pable to recover the NOB inhibition once the NOB inhibition was deteriorated.  In summary, when the NH 4  + -N concentration in the bulk liquid was higher than 3 – 5 mg-N/L, the CMABR could inhibit the activity of NOB by limiting the thickness of the aerobic zone and maintaining a low NO 2      -N concentration, thus made the number of NOB stabilize at a certain level. The residual NH 4  + -N concentration was regraded as an efficient strategy to inhibit NOB ( Poot et al., 2016 ;   Zheng et al., 2023 ).  Fig. 4.

When the NH 4  + -N concentration in the bulk liquid was low, the number of NOB kept a continuous increase due to more serious inhibition of AOB. The above results also reflected the potential disadvantage of CMABR in inhibiting NOB activity. Firstly, the AnAOB on the carriers was far away from the AOB on the membrane biofilm at the beginning, and the NO 2      -N concentration on the membrane biofilm couldn ’ t be fully reduced to inhibit NOB. Secondly, if CMABR couldn ’ t limit the expan -  sion of the aerobic biofilm, it would be likely to induce the increase of NOB. Therefore, it is challenging to achieve low effluent NH 4  + -N con -  centration and stable NOB suppression in CMABR simultaneously, and the optimization of operating conditions and operational modes is further required.  3.3.   The optimization operation by two-stage CMABRs  According to the results in   Section 3.2 , when the NH 4  + -N concen -  tration in CMABR was high with higher loading rate (lower HRT), the NOB inhibition effect was better. When the NH 4  + -N concentration was lower than 5 mg-N/L, the NOB activity cannot be inhibited. Further, the effect of internal circulation on PN/A performance and the mechanism of NOB inhibition were explored to for the optimization operation of CMABR ( Section 2   in SI). According to our experiment, when the in -  ternal circulation was lower, the NH 4  + -N concentration gradient formed was conductive to achieving a certain degree of NOB suppression (Fig. S2b), while the nitrogen removal rate was also affected by the poor mass transfer. Therefore, there was a contradiction between achieving a low effluent NH 4  + -N concentration and maintaining stable PN in CMABR (Fig. S2a & b). Based on the idea of establishing a concentration gradient for NOB inhibition, a two-stage CMABRs was designed. In the first stage, the NH 4  + -N concentration was high, which was able to achieve stable NOB suppression and a high nitrogen removal rate. In the second stage, although the NH 4  + -N concentration was low and totally NOB inhibition was not able to realize, the NOB activity could be maintained at a relatively low level because the influent concentration of substrate was lower.  The systems performance of two-stage CMABRs and the activities of AOB and NOB were shown in   Fig. 6 . PN was achieved and subsequent addition of carriers were operated respectively in the first-stage CMABR and second-stage CMABR on day 5, and each system was operated at the HRT of 3 h On day 12, the integrated operation of two-stage CMABRs was realized with a total HRT of 6 h It can be seen that the effluent NH 4  + - N concentration of two-stage CMABRs was able to stabilize below 5 mg- N/L after day 15th ( Fig. 6 c), and the total nitrogen concentration was stabilized below 15 mg-N/L, reaching the Class A standard for urban sewage discharge in China. Thereinto, the average concentration of NH 4  + -N and total nitrogen in the effluent of the first-stage CMABR was 20.0 mg-N/L and 24.2 mg-N/L, respectively ( Fig. 6 a), and 52 % of the total nitrogen was removed. The nitrogen removal rate was 207 g-N/ (m 3 ⋅ d), which was a relatively high level compared with other in -  vestigations ( Table 2 ). In terms of the stability of PN, the first-stage CMABR achieved relatively stable NOB suppression ( Fig. 6 b), and the NOB activity was mostly maintained below 10 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d), which was consistent with the performance observed at an HRT of 3 h in   Section 3.1 .).  The second-stage CMABR was operated with a circulation flow rate of 10 mL/min for better NOB suppression at the sacrifice of certain ni -  trogen removal rate, and the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration was below 2 mg-N/L ( Fig. 6 c), which was much lower than recent reports ( Bunse et al., 2024 ;   Zhang et al., 2024 ). After the integrated operation, NOB began to grow slowly with the NOB activity about 40 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d) eventually ( Fig. 6 d). However, since the HRT was only 3 h, the NO 3      -N accumulation resulted from NOB was little, and the effluent total ni -  trogen concentration was stable at 9.4 ± 2.4 mg-N/L. The total nitrogen removal efficiency was 30 % in second-stage CMABR, and the overall  Fig. 6.

total nitrogen removal efficiency of the series device reached to 81 %. The average nitrogen removal rate of the second-stage CMABR was 119 g-N/(m 3 ⋅ d), which was 40 % lower than that of the first stage. The reason could be ascribed to the NH 4  + -N concentration in the bulk liquid, lower circulation flow rate and the competition of NOB for NO 2      -N in second-stage CMABR.  A comprehensive comparison of the PN/A performance in the two- stage CMABRs and other relative MABR studies was shown in   Table 2 . It can be found that the two-stage CMABRs has great advantages in terms of the start-up time, HRT and the quality of effluent, and the nitrogen removal rate per unit membrane area was also at a high level. Thus, it can be considered that the CMABR showed significant potentials for mainstream nitrogen removal by PN/A in the future MABR applications.  3.4.   The microbial community  The microbial community under the optimized operational condition (day 50) was analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing to show the diversities of microbial genera and their relative abundances ( Fig. 7 ). M1, M2, C1, and C2 were the biofilm samples from the mem -  brane and carriers in first and second stages of the two-stage CMABRs, respectively. It showed the relative abundances of the top 19 bacteria at genus level.  The   dominant   genera   in   the   membrane   biofilm   were  Candidatus_Brocadia,   Candidatus_Kuenenia,   Nitrosomonas   and   Ohtaek -  wangia.   It showed the growth of AnAOB was expanded from the carriers to the membrane. Thereinto,   Candidatus_Brocadia   and   Candidatus_Kue -  nenia   were common AnAOB in wastewater treatment systems ( Zhou et al., 2023 ), and they held the proportions of 9.41 % and 6.39 % ( Table 3 ). Apart from that,   Candidatus_Jettenia   was also a typical AnAOB, which presented a higher percentage in the first-stage CMABR than that in the second-stage CMABR. In total, the percentages of AnAOB were 22.1 % and 12.2 % in first-stage CMABR and second-stage CMABR, respectively, which suggested that a higher concentration of substrate input contributed to a higher abundance of AnAOB.   Nitrosomonas,   as one of the most common AOB genera in the nitrogen removal process ( Reino et al., 2016 ), was the dominant AOB genus in both membrane biofilms with the percentage of 6.70 % and 8.63 % in first-stage CMABR and second-stage CMABR, respectively. The predominant position of   Nitro -  somonas   was also reported in other MABR systems ( Chen and Zhou, 2022 ;   Terada   et   al.,   2010 ).   It   was   interesting   that   Ohtaekwangia  accounted for 4.41 % and 5.51 % in first-stage CMABR and second-stage CMABR, and it was reported as a heterotrophic AOB for promoting PN process ( Zhou et al., 2018 ). It can be suggested that the growth of  Ohtaekwangia   was supported by the internal carbon from the decay of microbes, similar finding was reported in partial nitritation, partial denitrification and anammox in a sequencing batch reactor. The high percentage of AOB was responsible for efficient PN, which was corre -  sponded with the system performance.   Nitrospira , identified as a sig -  nificant NOB, presented in both biofilms with very tiny percentages (1 – 2 %) compared with AnAOB and AOB. However, the PN/A performance was not affected due to the inhibition effect of NOB. The results proved the special advantage of CMABR that significant AnAOB attached on the carriers would be beneficial to maintain the activity of AOB on the membrane and improve the nitrogen removal rate.  For the microbial community in the carriers of first-stage CMABR and   second-stage   CMABR,   the   dominant   genus   were   Candidatus_ -  Brocadia, Candidatus_Kuenenia   and   Ohtaekwangia. Candidatus_Brocadia  and   Candidatus_Kuenenia   were the majority of AnAOB on both biofilms of the carriers, with the percentage of 12 %-22 %.   Nitrosomonas   also presented on the carriers due to the expansion from membrane to carries. However, they held less percentage (less than 2 %) than on the  Table 2  An overall comparison of the PN/A performance in the two-stage CMABRs and other studies.

membrane (7 – 9 %). In terms of NOB, very few   Nitrospira   was detected, which explained NOB was inhibited by the abundant AnAOB. It was interesting to note that genera   Ignavibacterium   and   Denitratisoma   have been reported to be relative to denitrification ( Li et al., 2023a ;   Zhou et al., 2024 ), and both of them were shown in the two-stage CMABRs though no carbon source addition.   Chen and Zhou, (2022)   indicated that  Denitratisoma , as denitrifier, may be responsible to reduce the nitrate in the MABR system for mainstream nitrogen removal by PN/A. Further studies are needed to explore if there are contributions from the deni -  trifying bacteria for nitrogen removal in the current system.  3.5.   Future implementation of the PN/A in MABR  The proposed series CMABRs could potentially achieve PN/A for mainstream nitrogen removal. The novel design of the separated growth of AnAOB and nitrifying biomass was conductive for maintaining a relatively thin aerobic biofilm, thus, the mass transfer of NH 4  + -N and oxygen would not be affected. The contradiction between reducing the effluent NH 4  + -N concentration and maintaining NOB inhibition can be solved skilfully by the two-stage CMABRs with the effluent of the first stage as the influent of the second stage, and with the final effluent NH 4  + - N concentration of 1.7   ±   1.2 mg-N/L. Secondly, the privilege of nitrite utilization by AnAOB could contribute to the NOB inhibition and effi -  cient nitrogen removal ( Lu et al., 2023 ). However, the potential disad -  vantage couldn ’ t be ignored was that due to the two locational AnAOB and AOB at the beginning, it would pose challenge for NOB inhibition on the membrane due to a higher nitrite concentration on the membrane biofilm.  Thus, as strategies for well-designed optimization, a relatively high NH 4  + -N loading for efficient mass transfer and an efficient number of AnAOB were recommended to assure the utilization of nitrite by AnAOB. In addition, a relatively low DO concentration was necessary for NOB inhibition and numerous researches have proved that by intermittent aeration or closed-end aeration mode ( Bunse et al., 2020 ;   Chen et al., 2022 ). Specially, this study employed the high influent NH 4  + -N load and open-end aeration mode in the first 10 days and closed-end mode sub -  sequently allowed superior PN and NOB suppression for a fast start-up MABR process ( Wang et al., 2024 ). Other interesting studies may pro -  vide novel perspectives with the help of acid-tolerant AOB in MABR system due to less dependence on the influent alkalinity ( Niu et al., 2024 ;   Wang et al., 2021 ). However, the integration of other units or controlling strategies are necessary for them to consider.  Last but not least, this study didn ’ t involve organic carbon. In the case of real wastewater, heterotrophs would use the carbon source to grow and consume nitrate/nitrite. The consumption of nitrate could be conductive to nitrogen removal, but the utilization of nitrite would consume the substrate of NOB and AnAOB. On one hand, the attachment of heterotrophs on the outer layer of biofilm would be beneficial for the suppression of NOB by consuming nitrite. On the other hand, it would be not problematic when the COD is not too high ( Gao et al., 2021 ;   Pijuan et al., 2020 ). The integration of anaerobic pretreatment with MABR to consume part of COD could be a strategy, and elaborate strategies to control the membrane thickness are also significant to maintain a stable PN/A process ( Bunse et al., 2024 ;   Zhang et al., 2024 ). All in all, more investigations on the employment of real wastewater and parameters optimization are required to determine the suitability of this novel de -  vice for the large-scale application.  4.   Conclusions  This   investigation   proposed   a   novel   carriers-coupled   MABR (CMABR) for mainstream nitrogen removal by PN/A process. The effects of HRT on nitrogen removal performance and NOB inhibition were investigated, and the optimized strategy was proposed. The main con -  clusions were as follows:  (1)   When the HRT was increased from 3 h to 6 h, the nitrogen removal rate decreased slowly, and the effluent NH 4  + -N concen -  tration of the CMABR gradually decreased to less than 1 mg-N/L. It proved that CMABR can simultaneously achieve a higher ni -  trogen removal rate and effluent quality.  (2)   The changes in the activities of AOB and NOB with the increase of HRT (i.e., the decrease of NH 4  + -N concentration) showed the contradiction between reducing the effluent NH 4  + -N concentra -  tion and maintaining NOB inhibition. Higher than 5 mg-N/L of residual NH 4  + -N was able to stabilize NOB activity at a low level.  (3)   The   noteworthy   advantage   of   CMABR   was   that   significant AnAOB attached on the carriers, which was conductive to the mass transfer of NH 4  + -N in the biofilm and maintain the activity of AOB, thus improved the nitrogen removal rate and effluent quality.  (4)   The operation of two-stage CMABRs assured successful PN/A performance. The current results solved the trick problem to inhibit NOB and realize efficient nitrogen removal performance through CMABR design, which would be beneficial to establish -  ing autotrophic nitrogen removal by MABR.
